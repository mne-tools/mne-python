    """Compute the Phase Slope Index (PSI) connectivity measure.

    The PSI is an effective connectivity measure, i.e., a measure which can
    give an indication of the direction of the information flow (causality).
    For two time series, and one computes the PSI between the first and the
    second time series as follows

    indices = (np.array([0]), np.array([1]))
    psi = phase_slope_index(data, indices=indices, ...)

    A positive value means that time series 0 is ahead of time series 1 and
    a negative value means the opposite.

    The PSI is computed from the coherency (see spectral_connectivity), details
    can be found in [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, shape=(n_epochs, n_signals, n_times)
        Can also be a list/generator of array, shape =(n_signals, n_times);
        list/generator of SourceEstimate; or Epochs.
        The data from which to compute connectivity. Note that it is also
        possible to combine multiple signals by providing a list of tuples,
        e.g., data = [(arr_0, stc_0), (arr_1, stc_1), (arr_2, stc_2)],
        corresponds to 3 epochs, and arr_* could be an array with the same
        number of time points as stc_*.
    indices : tuple of array | None
        Two arrays with indices of connections for which to compute
        connectivity. If None, all connections are computed.
    sfreq : float
        The sampling frequency.
    mode : str
        Spectrum estimation mode can be either: 'multitaper', 'fourier', or
        'cwt_morlet'.
    fmin : float | tuple of float
        The lower frequency of interest. Multiple bands are defined using
        a tuple, e.g., (8., 20.) for two bands with 8Hz and 20Hz lower freq.
        If None the frequency corresponding to an epoch length of 5 cycles
        is used.
    fmax : float | tuple of float
        The upper frequency of interest. Multiple bands are dedined using
        a tuple, e.g. (13., 30.) for two band with 13Hz and 30Hz upper freq.
    tmin : float | None
        Time to start connectivity estimation.
    tmax : float | None
        Time to end connectivity estimation.
    mt_bandwidth : float | None
        The bandwidth of the multitaper windowing function in Hz.
        Only used in 'multitaper' mode.
    mt_adaptive : bool
        Use adaptive weights to combine the tapered spectra into PSD.
        Only used in 'multitaper' mode.
    mt_low_bias : bool
        Only use tapers with more than 90%% spectral concentration within
        bandwidth. Only used in 'multitaper' mode.
    cwt_freqs : array
        Array of frequencies of interest. Only used in 'cwt_morlet' mode.
    cwt_n_cycles : float | array of float
        Number of cycles. Fixed number or one per frequency. Only used in
        'cwt_morlet' mode.
    block_size : int
        How many connections to compute at once (higher numbers are faster
        but require more memory).
    n_jobs : int
        How many epochs to process in parallel.
    %(verbose)s

    Returns
    -------
    psi : array
        Computed connectivity measure(s). The shape of each array is either
        (n_signals, n_signals, n_bands) mode: 'multitaper' or 'fourier'
        (n_signals, n_signals, n_bands, n_times) mode: 'cwt_morlet'
        when "indices" is None, or
        (n_con, n_bands) mode: 'multitaper' or 'fourier'
        (n_con, n_bands, n_times) mode: 'cwt_morlet'
        when "indices" is specified and "n_con = len(indices[0])".
    freqs : array
        Frequency points at which the connectivity was computed.
    times : array
        Time points for which the connectivity was computed.
    n_epochs : int
        Number of epochs used for computation.
    n_tapers : int
        The number of DPSS tapers used. Only defined in 'multitaper' mode.
        Otherwise None is returned.
