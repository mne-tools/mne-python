Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Update ``surfaces`` argument in :func:`mne.viz.plot_alignment` to allow dict for transparency values, and set default for sEEG data to have transparency (by `Keith Doelling`_ (:gh:`8445`))

- Add ``n_pca_components`` argument to :func:`mne.viz.plot_ica_overlay` by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8351`)

- Add :func:`mne.stc_near_sensors` to facilitate plotting ECoG data by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8190`)

- Add ``proj`` argument to :func:`mne.make_fixed_length_epochs` by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8351`)

- Reduce memory usage of volume source spaces by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8379`)

- Speed up heavy use of :meth:`mne.SourceMorph.apply` for volumetric source spaces by use of the method :meth:`mne.SourceMorph.compute_vol_morph_mat` by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8366`)

- Add support for non-uniform ``zooms`` (e.g., when using a surrogate MRI via :func:`mne.scale_mri`) in volumetric morphing by `Eric Larson`_  (:gh:`8642`)

- In :func:`mne.compute_source_morph` ``zooms`` are no longer required to match the spacing of ``src_to``, which is useful to ensure the morphing is accurate when the ``src_to`` spacing is large (e.g., 1 cm) by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8642`)

- Add volumetric source space support to :func:`mne.labels_to_stc` by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8447`)

- Add sEEG source visualization using :func:`mne.stc_near_sensors` and sEEG working tutorial by `Eric Larson`_ and `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`8402`)

- Add :meth:`mne.channels.DigMontage.get_positions`, which will return a dictionary of channel positions, coordinate frame and fiducial locations by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`8460`)

- Add ``picks`` parameter to :func:`mne.preprocessing.fix_stim_artifact` to specify which channel needs to be fixed, by `Alex Gramfort`_ (:gh:`8482`)


Bugs
~~~~

- Fix bug with reading split files that have dashes in the filename **by new contributor** |Eduard Ort|_ (:gh:`8339`)

- Fix bug with `~mne.viz.plot_epochs_image` when ``order`` is supplied and multiple conditions are plotted by `Daniel McCloy`_ (:gh:`8377`)

- Fix bug with :func:`mne.viz.plot_source_estimates` when using the PyVista backend where singleton time points were not handled properly by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8285`)

- Fix bug when passing ``axes`` to plotting functions, :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.tight_layout` will not be called when the figure was created using a constrained layout by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8344`)

- Fix bug with compensated CTF data when picking channels without preload by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8318`)

- Fix bug when merging fNIRS channels in :func:`mne.viz.plot_evoked_topomap` and related functions by `Robert Luke`_ (:gh:`8306`)

- Fix bug where events could overflow when writing to FIF by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8448`)

- :func:`mne.io.read_raw_edf` now supports EDF files with invalid recording dates by `Clemens Brunner`_ (:gh:`8283`)

- Fix bug with :func:`mne.io.Raw.save` when using ``split_naming='bids'`` where non-split files would still be named ``name_split-01_meg.fif`` instead of the requested ``name_meg.fif`` by `Alex Gramfort`_ and `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8464`)

- Fix bug with :class:`mne.preprocessing.ICA` where ``n_pca_components`` as a :class:`python:float` would give the number of components that explained less than or equal to the given variance. It now gives greater than the given number for better usability and consistency with :class:`sklearn.decomposition.PCA`. Generally this will mean that one more component will be included, by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8326`)

- Fix bug with :class:`mne.preprocessing.ICA` where projections were not tracked properly by `Eric Larson`_

- Fix bug with :func:`mne.preprocessing.read_ica_eeglab` where full-rank data were not handled properly by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8326`)

- Fix bug with :ref:`somato-dataset` where the BEM was not included by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8317`)

- Fix bug with coordinate frames when performing volumetric morphs via :func:`mne.compute_source_morph` and :meth:`mne.SourceMorph.apply` that could lead to ~5 mm bias by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8642`)

- Fix missing documentation of :func:`mne.io.read_raw_nihon` in :ref:`tut-imorting-eeg-data` by `Adam Li`_ (:gh`8320`)

- ``ICA.max_pca_components`` will not be altered by calling `~mne.preprocessing.ICA.fit` anymore. Instead, the new attribute ``ICA.max_pca_components_`` will be set, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`8321`)

- Fix bug that `~mne.viz.plot_ica_overlay` would sometimes not create red traces, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (:gh:`8341`)

- Fix bug with :class:`~mne.preprocessing.ICA` where ``n_components=None, n_pca_components=None`` could lead to unstable unmixing matrix inversion by making ``n_components=None`` also use the lesser of ``n_components=0.999999`` and ``n_components=n_pca_components`` by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8351`)

- The ``ica.n_pca_components`` property is no longer be updated during :meth:`mne.preprocessing.ICA.fit`, instead ``ica.n_components_`` will be added to the instance by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`8351`)

- Pass ``rank`` everyhwere in forward preparation for source imaging. This bug affected sparse solvers when using maxfilter data, by `Alex Gramfort`_ (:gh:`8368`)

- Fix bug where BrainVision channel names, event types, and event descriptions containing commas were incorrectly parsed (:gh:`8492` by `Stefan Appelhoff`_)
