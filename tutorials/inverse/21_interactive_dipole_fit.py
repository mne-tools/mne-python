=====================================================================
Source localization by guided equivalent current dipole (ECD) fitting
=====================================================================

This combination of manual specification and automated fitting is one of the oldest MEG
source estimation techniques :footcite:`Sarvas1987`. We will manually identify where and
when dipole source are active, upon which the fitting algorithm will find the best
location for the source. The result is a sparse source estimate of several equivalent
current dipoles (ECDs) that together explain (most of) the MEG evoked response. ECDs are
especially suited for capturing individual components of an evoked response (e.g. N100m,
N400m, etc.). Once the set of ECDs has been established, their timecourses can be
computed for multiple :class:`~mne.Evoked` objects, for example different experimental
conditions.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to fit ECDs using the interactive GUI and also how to
do it using Python code.

# Guided ECD fitting using the GUI
# --------------------------------
#
# Starting the GUI
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We can start the GUI either from the command line by using the ``mne dipolefit``
# program. By default it will load an evoked response from the MNE-Sample data, which
# is what we will use in this tutorial. To load your own data, use the ``-e
# EVOKED_FILE`` option to load an evoked response from a file (filename typically ends
# in ``*-ave.fif``).
#
# The GUI can also be started from an interactive python console:
import mne

mne.gui.dipolefit()

# %%
# Without specifying anything about the head model, the GUI shows the minimal setup that
# can be used to fit dipoles: the sensors, a spherical head model and the
# electro-magnetic field recorded by the sensors, using an ad-hoc noise covariance
# matrix. If we provide more information, we can create a more accurate head model that
# provides better ECD fits and gives us more guidance for determining sources. On the
# command line there are various options you can use to specify files containing the
# covariance matrix, BEM model and MRI<->head transformation, see the output of ``mne
# dipolefit --help``.
#
# In an interactive python console, we can provide the appropriate MNE-Python objects
# when starting the GUI:
path = mne.datasets.sample.data_path()
meg_dir = path / "MEG" / "sample"
subjects_dir = path / "subjects"

evoked = mne.read_evokeds(meg_dir / "sample_audvis-ave.fif", condition="Left Auditory")
evoked.apply_baseline()
cov = mne.read_cov(meg_dir / "sample_audvis-cov.fif")
bem = mne.read_bem_solution(
    subjects_dir / "sample" / "bem" / "sample-5120-5120-5120-bem-sol.fif"
)
trans = mne.read_trans(meg_dir / "sample_audvis_raw-trans.fif")

# A distributed source estimate is a helpful guide for our dipole fits.
inv = mne.minimum_norm.read_inverse_operator(
    meg_dir / "sample_audvis-meg-oct-6-meg-inv.fif"
)
stc = mne.minimum_norm.apply_inverse(evoked, inv)

# Open the GUI with a better head model.
fitting_gui = mne.gui.dipolefit(
    evoked,
    cov=cov,
    bem=bem,
    trans=trans,
    stc=stc,
    ch_type="meg",  # only use MEG sensors for this tutorial
    subject="sample",
    subjects_dir=subjects_dir,
)

# %%
# During guided ECD fitting, we look for patterns in the eletro-magnetic field to
# identify when and where sources may be active. We can use the time slider to examine
# how the field changes over time. The sample data is an evoked response to an auditory
# tone being played to the left of the participant and we can see the initial auditory
# response peaking at around 85 ms on the right hemisphere. The field shows a typical
# di-polar pattern with a pair of red/blue focii on either side of the source that
# should be located in auditory cortex (the distributed source estimates shows where it
# is).
#
# By pressing the "Fit dipole" button we instruct the algorithm to fit a dipole at the
# current time. After a few seconds of computation, the resulting dipole will be
# displayed as a arrow in the brain, indicating its source, as well as an arrow on the
# MEG helmet indicating the fit between the dipole and the field pattern. The timecourse
# of the dipole is shown below. On the right are controls to name, remove, temporarily
# (de-)activate, and save the dipole to a file. You also find a toggle switch to make
# the dipole's orientation dynamic or keep it fixed at the orientation it had at the
# time when it was fitted.
#
# Selecting channels to guide the ECD modeling
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# At nearly the same time, auditory responses are occurring in both left and right
# auditory cortex. Hence, the single dipole that we fitted without any guidance will
# have some bias as the algorithm attempted to fit the ECD to the entire bi-lateral
# field pattern.
#
# To isolate portions of the field pattern that contain a single pair of red/blue focii,
# the ideal fitting target for the algorithm, we can restrict the analysis to a subset
# of sensors. To do so, first press the "Sensor data" button, which will open a new
# window showing the evoked response across all sensors. By clicking and dragging the
# mouse we can make a lasso selection around the sensors we wish to include in the
# analysis. Hold ``CTRL`` to add to the current selection and ``CTRL + SHIFT`` to remove
# from the current selection. The currently selected sensors are highlighted in green in
# the main window, showing the portion of the field pattern they cover. When you are
# happy with the selection, you can use the "Fit dipole" button as before to fit a
# dipole using the selected sensors at the current timepoint.
#
# Remove or de-activate the dipole we previously fitted to the entire field pattern and
# fit two dipoles using the left-side and right-side sensors respectively. It is helpful
# to name them.
#
# Multi/single dipole modes
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# By default, the fitting algorithm is in "Multi dipole (MNE)" mode, meaning portions of
# the signal attributed to one dipole can not be attributed to a second dipole at the
# same time. You will notice that if you have two dipoles with similar orientations
# close to each other, their timecourses become a strange mixture as each dipole will
# claim a part of the same signal. To prevent this, we can switch the algorithm over to
# "Single dipole". In this mode, the timecourse of each dipole will be computed whilst
# ignoring all other dipoles, which is useful when evaluating multiple candidate dipoles
# for the same source.
#
# Saving and loading sets of dipoles
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# We can save the fitted dipoles using the "Save dipoles" button. There are two possible
# file formats for this: plain text (``.dip``) and a binary format (``.bdip``). These
# are formats are compatible with MegIn's software, allowing interoperability between
# MNE-Python and Xfit. The fitted dipoles can also be accessed and saved through Python
# code:
fitted_dipoles = fitting_gui.dipoles  # the dipoles we fitted
# save with: fitted_dipoles.save("my_file.dip")

# %%
# Saved dipoles can be loaded with :func:`mne.read_dipole` and added to an existing
# dipole fitting GUI like so:
dips_to_add = mne.read_dipole(meg_dir / "sample_audvis_set1.dip")
dips_to_add = dips_to_add[[27, 33]]  # add only two of the 34 dipoles in the file
name = ["rh", "lh"]  # we can give names to the dipoles if we want
fitting_gui = mne.gui.dipolefit()
fitting_gui.add_dipole(dips_to_add, name=name)
