MEG/EEG and MRI coordinate systems
##################################

The coordinate systems used in MNE software (and FreeSurfer)
and their relationships are depicted in :ref:`CHDFFJIJ`.
Except for the *Sensor coordinates*, all of the
coordinate systems are Cartesian and have the "RAS" (Right-Anterior-Superior)
orientation, *i.e.*, the :math:`x` axis
points to the right, the :math:`y` axis
to the front, and the :math:`z` axis up.

    MEG/EEG and MRI coordinate systems

    The coordinate transforms present in the fif files in MNE and the FreeSurfer files as well as those set to fixed values are indicated with :math:`T_x`, where :math:`x` identifies the transformation.

The coordinate systems related
to MEG/EEG data are:

**Head coordinates**

    This is a coordinate system defined with help of the fiducial landmarks
    (nasion and the two auricular points). In fif files, EEG electrode
    locations are given in this coordinate system. In addition, the head
    digitization data acquired in the beginning of an MEG, MEG/EEG,
    or EEG acquisition are expressed in head coordinates. For details,
    see :ref:`CHDEDFIB`.

**Device coordinates**

    This is a coordinate system tied to the MEG device. The relationship
    of the Device and Head coordinates is determined during an MEG measurement
    by feeding current to three to five head-position
    indicator (HPI) coils and by determining their locations with respect
    to the MEG sensor array from the magnetic fields they generate.

**Sensor coordinates**

    Each MEG sensor has a local coordinate system defining the orientation
    and location of the sensor. With help of this coordinate system,
    the numerical integration data needed for the computation of the
    magnetic field can be expressed conveniently as discussed in :ref:`BJEIAEIE`. The channel information data in the fif files
    contain the information to specify the coordinate transformation
    between the coordinates of each sensor and the MEG device coordinates.

The coordinate systems related
to MRI data are:

**Surface RAS coordinates**

    The FreeSurfer surface data are expressed in this coordinate system. The
    origin of this coordinate system is at the center of the conformed
    FreeSurfer MRI volumes (usually 256 x 256 x 256 isotropic 1-mm3  voxels)
    and the axes are oriented along the axes of this volume. The BEM
    surface and the locations of the sources in the source space are
    usually expressed in this coordinate system in the fif files. In
    this manual, the *Surface RAS coordinates* are
    usually referred to as *MRI coordinates* unless
    there is need to specifically discuss the different MRI-related
    coordinate systems.

**RAS coordinates**

    This coordinate system has axes identical to the Surface RAS coordinates but the location of the origin
    is different and defined by the original MRI data, i.e. ,
    the origin is in a scanner-dependent location. There is hardly any
    need to refer to this coordinate system explicitly in the analysis
    with the MNE software. However, since the Talairach coordinates,
    discussed below, are defined with respect to *RAS coordinates* rather
    than the *Surface RAS coordinates*, the RAS coordinate
    system is implicitly involved in the transformation between Surface RAS coordinates and the two *Talairach* coordinate
    systems.

**MNI Talairach coordinates**

    The definition of this coordinate system is discussed, e.g. ,
    in  http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/MniTalairach. This
    transformation is determined during the FreeSurfer reconstruction
    process.

**FreeSurfer Talairach coordinates**

    The problem with the MNI Talairach coordinates is that the linear MNI
    Talairach transform does matched the brains completely to the Talairach
    brain. This is probably because the Talairach atlas brain is a rather
    odd shape, and as a result, it is difficult to match a standard brain
    to the atlas brain using an affine transform. As a result, the MNI
    brains are slightly larger (in particular higher, deeper and longer)
    than the Talairach brain. The differences are larger as you get
    further from the middle of the brain, towards the outside. The FreeSurfer
    Talairach coordinates mitigate this problem by additing a an additional
    transformation, defined separately for negatice and positive MNI
    Talairach :math:`z` coordinates. These two
    transformations, denoted by :math:`T_-` and :math:`T_+` in :ref:`CHDFFJIJ`, are fixed as discussed in http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/MniTalairach
    (*Approach 2*).

The different coordinate systems are related by coordinate
transformations depicted in :ref:`CHDFFJIJ`. The arrows and
coordinate transformation symbols (:math:`T_x`)
indicate the transformations actually present in the FreeSurfer
files. Generally,

.. math::    \begin{bmatrix}
		x_2 \\
		y_2 \\
		z_2 \\
		1
	        \end{bmatrix} = T_{12} \begin{bmatrix}
		x_1 \\
		y_1 \\
		z_1 \\
		1
	        \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
		R_{11} & R_{12} & R_{13} & x_0 \\
		R_{13} & R_{13} & R_{13} & y_0 \\
		R_{13} & R_{13} & R_{13} & z_0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	        \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
		x_1 \\
		y_1 \\
		z_1 \\
		1
	        \end{bmatrix}\ ,

where :math:`x_k`,:math:`y_k`,and :math:`z_k` are the location
coordinates in two coordinate systems, :math:`T_{12}` is
the coordinate transformation from coordinate system "1" to "2",
:math:`x_0`, :math:`y_0`,and :math:`z_0` is the location of the origin
of coordinate system "1" in coordinate system "2",
and :math:`R_{jk}` are the elements of the rotation
matrix relating the two coordinate systems. The coordinate transformations
are present in different files produced by FreeSurfer and MNE as
summarized in :ref:`CHDJDEDJ`. The fixed transformations :math:`T_-` and :math:`T_+` are:

.. math::    T_{-} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.99 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0.9688 & 0.042 & 0 \\
		0 & -0.0485 & 0.839 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	        \end{bmatrix}

and

.. math::    T_{+} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.99 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0.9688 & 0.046 & 0 \\
		0 & -0.0485 & 0.9189 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	        \end{bmatrix}

.. note:: This section does not discuss the transformation    between the MRI voxel indices and the different MRI coordinates.    However, it is important to note that in FreeSurfer, MNE, as well    as in Neuromag software an integer voxel coordinate corresponds    to the location of the center of a voxel. Detailed information on    the FreeSurfer MRI systems can be found at  https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/CoordinateSystems.

The head and device coordinate systems
######################################

.. figure:: ../pics/HeadCS.png
    :alt: Head coordinate system

    The head coordinate system

The MEG/EEG head coordinate system employed in the MNE software
is a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system. The direction of :math:`x` axis
is from left to right, that of :math:`y` axis
to the front, and the :math:`z` axis thus
points up.

The :math:`x` axis of the head coordinate
system passes through the two periauricular or preauricular points
digitized before acquiring the data with positive direction to the
right. The :math:`y` axis passes through
the nasion and is normal to the :math:`x` axis.
The :math:`z` axis points up according to
the right-hand rule and is normal to the :math:`xy` plane.

The origin of the MEG device coordinate system is device
dependent. Its origin is located approximately at the center of
a sphere which fits the occipital section of the MEG helmet best
with :math:`x` axis axis going from left to right
and :math:`y` axis pointing front. The :math:`z` axis
is, again, normal to the :math:`xy` plane
with positive direction up.

.. note:: The above definition is identical to that    of the Neuromag MEG/EEG (head) coordinate system. However, in 4-D    Neuroimaging and CTF MEG systems the head coordinate frame definition    is different. The origin of the coordinate system is at the midpoint    of the left and right auricular points. The :math:`x` axis    passes through the nasion and the origin with positive direction    to the front. The :math:`y` axis is perpendicular    to the :math:`x` axis on the and lies in    the plane defined by the three fiducial landmarks, positive direction    from right to left. The :math:`z` axis is    normal to the plane of the landmarks, pointing up. Note that in    this convention the auricular points are not necessarily located    on :math:`y` coordinate axis. The file conversion utilities take care of these idiosyncrasies and convert all coordinate information    to the MNE software head coordinate frame.

Creating a surface-based source space
#####################################

The fif format source space files containing the dipole locations
and orientations are created with the utility :ref:`mne_make_source_space`.
This utility is usually invoked by the convenience script :ref:`mne_setup_source_space`,
see :ref:`CIHCHDAE`.


.. _BJEFEHJI:

Creating a volumetric or discrete source space
##############################################

In addition to source spaces confined to a surface, the MNE
software provides some support for three-dimensional source spaces
bounded by a surface as well as source spaces comprised of discrete,
arbitrarily located source points. The :ref:`mne_volume_source_space` utility
assists in generating such source spaces.


.. _BEHCACCJ:

Creating the BEM meshes
#######################

The :ref:`mne_surf2bem` utility
converts surface triangle meshes from ASCII and FreeSurfer binary
file formats to the fif format. The resulting fiff file also contains
conductivity information so that it can be employed in the BEM calculations.
See command-line options in :ref:`mne_surf2bem`.

.. note:: The utility ``mne_tri2fiff`` previously used for this task has been replaced by :ref:`mne_surf2bem`.

.. note:: The convenience script :ref:`mne_setup_forward_model` described in :ref:`CIHDBFEG` calls :ref:`mne_surf2bem` with the appropriate options.

.. note:: The vertices of all surfaces should be given in the MRI coordinate system.


.. _BEHDEFCD:

Tessellation file format
========================

The format of the text format surface files is the following:

  | <*nvert*>
  | <*vertex 1*>
  | <*vertex 2*>
  | ...
  | <*vertex nvert*>
  | <*ntri*>
  | <*triangle 1*>
  | <*triangle 2*>
  | ...
  | <*triangle ntri*> ,

where <*nvert*> and <*ntri*> are
the number of vertices and number of triangles in the tessellation,
respectively.

The format of a vertex entry is
one of the following:

**x y z**

    The x, y, and z coordinates of the vertex location are given in
    mm.

**number x y z**

    A running number and the x, y, and z coordinates are given. The running
    number is not considered by mne_tri2fiff. The nodes must be thus
    listed in the correct consecutive order.

**x y z nx ny nz**

    The x, y, and z coordinates as well as the approximate vertex normal direction
    cosines are given.

**number x y z nx ny nz**

    A running number is given in addition to the vertex location and vertex
    normal.

Each triangle entry consists of the numbers of the vertices
belonging to a triangle. The vertex numbering starts from one. The
triangle list may also contain running numbers on each line describing
a triangle.

.. _BEHCBDDE:

Topology checks
===============

If the ``--check`` option is specified, the following
topology checks are performed:

- The completeness of each surface is
  confirmed by calculating the total solid angle subtended by all
  triangles from a point inside the triangulation. The result should
  be very close to :math:`4 \pi`. If the result
  is :math:`-4 \pi` instead, it is conceivable
  that the ordering of the triangle vertices is incorrect and the
  ``--swap`` option should be specified.

- The correct ordering of the surfaces is verified by checking
  that the surfaces are inside each other as expected. This is accomplished
  by checking that the sum solid angles subtended by triangles of
  a surface :math:`S_k` at all vertices of another
  surface :math:`S_p` which is supposed to be
  inside it equals :math:`4 \pi`. Naturally, this
  check is applied only if the model has more than one surface. Since
  the surface relations are transitive, it is enough to check that
  the outer skull surface is inside the skin surface and that the
  inner skull surface is inside the outer skull one.

- The extent of each of the triangulated volumes is checked.
  If the extent is smaller than 50mm, an error is reported. This
  may indicate that the vertex coordinates have been specified in
  meters instead of millimeters.

Computing the BEM geometry data
###############################

The utility :ref:`mne_prepare_bem_model` computes
the geometry information for BEM. This utility is usually invoked
by the convenience script :ref:`mne_setup_forward_model`,
see :ref:`CIHDBFEG`. The command-line options are listed under
:ref:`mne_prepare_bem_model`.


.. _BJEIAEIE:

Coil geometry information
#########################

This Section explains the presentation of MEG detection coil
geometry information the approximations used for different detection
coils in MNE software. Two pieces of information are needed to characterize
the detectors:

- The location and orientation a local
  coordinate system for each detector.

- A unique identifier, which has an one-to-one correspondence
  to the geometrical description of the coil.

The sensor coordinate system
============================

The sensor coordinate system is completely characterized
by the location of its origin and the direction cosines of three
orthogonal unit vectors pointing to the directions of the x, y,
and z axis. In fact, the unit vectors contain redundant information
because the orientation can be uniquely defined with three angles.
The measurement fif files list these data in MEG device coordinates.
Transformation to the MEG head coordinate frame can be easily accomplished
by applying the device-to-head coordinate transformation matrix
available in the data files provided that the head-position indicator
was used. Optionally, the MNE software forward calculation applies
another coordinate transformation to the head-coordinate data to
bring the coil locations and orientations to the MRI coordinate system.

If :math:`r_0` is a row vector for
the origin of the local sensor coordinate system and :math:`e_x`, :math:`e_y`, and :math:`e_z` are the row vectors for the
three orthogonal unit vectors, all given in device coordinates,
a location of a point :math:`r_C` in sensor coordinates
is transformed to device coordinates (:math:`r_D`)
by

.. math::    [r_D 1] = [r_C 1] T_{CD}\ ,

where

.. math::    T = \begin{bmatrix}
		e_x & 0 \\
		e_y & 0 \\
		e_z & 0 \\
		r_{0D} & 1
	        \end{bmatrix}\ .

Calculation of the magnetic field
=================================

The forward calculation in the MNE software computes the
signals detected by each MEG sensor for three orthogonal dipoles
at each source space location. This requires specification of the
conductor model, the location and orientation of the dipoles, and
the location and orientation of each MEG sensor as well as its coil
geometry.

The output of each SQUID sensor is a weighted sum of the
magnetic fluxes threading the loops comprising the detection coil.
Since the flux threading a coil loop is an integral of the magnetic
field component normal to the coil plane, the output of the k :sup:`th`
MEG channel, :math:`b_k` can be approximated by:

.. math::    b_k = \sum_{p = 1}^{N_k} {w_{kp} B(r_{kp}) \cdot n_{kp}}

where :math:`r_{kp}` are a set of :math:`N_k` integration
points covering the pickup coil loops of the sensor, :math:`B(r_{kp})` is
the magnetic field due to the current sources calculated at :math:`r_{kp}`, :math:`n_{kp}` are
the coil normal directions at these points, and :math:`w_{kp}` are
the weights associated to the integration points. This formula essentially
presents numerical integration of the magnetic field over the pickup
loops of sensor :math:`k`.

There are three accuracy levels for the numerical integration
expressed above. The *simple* accuracy means
the simplest description of the coil. This accuracy is not used
in the MNE forward calculations. The *normal* or *recommended* accuracy typically uses
two integration points for planar gradiometers, one in each half
of the pickup coil and four evenly distributed integration points
for magnetometers. This is the default accuracy used by MNE. If
the ``--accurate`` option is specified, the forward calculation typically employs
a total of eight integration points for planar gradiometers and
sixteen for magnetometers. Detailed information about the integration
points is given in the next section.

Implemented coil geometries
===========================

This section describes the coil geometries currently implemented
in Neuromag software. The coil types fall in two general categories:

- Axial gradiometers and planar gradiometers
  and

- Planar gradiometers.

For axial sensors, the *z* axis of the
local coordinate system is parallel to the field component detected, *i.e.*,
normal to the coil plane.For circular coils, the orientation of
the *x* and *y* axes on the
plane normal to the z axis is irrelevant. In the square coils employed
in the Vectorview (TM) system the *x* axis
is chosen to be parallel to one of the sides of the magnetometer
coil. For planar sensors, the *z* axis is likewise
normal to the coil plane and the x axis passes through the centerpoints
of the two coil loops so that the detector gives a positive signal
when the normal field component increases along the *x* axis.

:ref:`BGBBHGEC` lists the parameters of the *normal* coil
geometry descriptions :ref:`CHDBDFJE` lists the *accurate* descriptions. For simple accuracy,
please consult the coil definition file, see :ref:`BJECIGEB`.
The columns of the tables contain the following data:

- The number identifying the coil id.
  This number is used in the coil descriptions found in the FIF files.

- Description of the coil.

- Number of integration points used

- The locations of the integration points in sensor coordinates.

- Weights assigned to the field values at the integration points.
  Some formulas are listed instead of the numerical values to demonstrate
  the principle of the calculation. For example, in the normal coil
  descriptions of the planar gradiometers the weights are inverses
  of the baseline of the gradiometer to show that the output is in
  T/m.

.. note:: The coil geometry information is stored in the file $MNE_ROOT/share/mne/coil_def.dat, which is automatically created by the utility mne_list_coil_def , see :ref:`BJEHHJIJ`.

The coil definition file
========================

The coil geometry information is stored in the text file
$MNE_ROOT/share/mne/coil_def.dat. In this file, any lines starting
with the pound sign (#) are comments. A coil definition starts with
a description line containing the following fields:

** <*class*>**

    This is a number indicating class of this coil. Possible values
    are listed in :ref:`BJEFABHA`.

** <*id*>**

    Coil id value. This value is listed in the first column of Tables :ref:`BGBBHGEC` and :ref:`CHDBDFJE`.

** <*accuracy*>**

    The coil representation accuracy. Possible values and their meanings
    are listed in :ref:`BJEHIBJC`.

** <*np*>**

    Number of integration points in this representation.

** <*size/m*>**

    The size of the coil. For circular coils this is the diameter of
    the coil and for square ones the side length of the square. This
    information is mainly included to facilitate drawing of the coil
    geometry. It should not be employed to infer a coil approximation
    for the forward calculations.

** <*baseline/m*>**

    The baseline of a this kind of a coil. This will be zero for magnetometer
    coils. This information is mainly included to facilitate drawing
    of the coil geometry. It should not be employed to infer a coil
    approximation for the forward calculations.

** <*description*>**

    Short description of this kind of a coil. If the description contains several
    words, it is enclosed in quotes.

    =======  =====================================================================

Each coil description line is followed by one or more integration
point lines, consisting of seven numbers:

** <*weight*>**

    Gives the weight for this integration point (last column in Tables :ref:`BGBBHGEC` and :ref:`CHDBDFJE`).

** <*x/m*> <*y/m*> <*z/m*>**

    Indicates the location of the integration point (fourth column in Tables :ref:`BGBBHGEC` and :ref:`CHDBDFJE`).

** <*nx*> <*ny*> <*nz*>**

    Components of a unit vector indicating the field component to be selected.
    Note that listing a separate unit vector for each integration points
    allows the implementation of curved coils and coils with the gradiometer
    loops tilted with respect to each other.

Creating the coil definition file
=================================

The standard coil definition file $MNE_ROOT/share/mne/coil_def.dat
is included with the MNE software package. The coil definition file
can be recreated with the utility mne_list_coil_def
as follows:

mne_list_coil_def --out $MNE_ROOT/share/mne/coil_def.dat

Computing the forward solution
##############################

Purpose
=======

Instead of using the convenience script :ref:`mne_do_forward_solution` it
is also possible to invoke the forward solution computation program :ref:`mne_forward_solution` directly.
In this approach, the convenience of the automatic file naming conventions
present in :ref:`mne_do_forward_solution` are
lost. However, there are some special-purpose options available
in :ref:`mne_forward_solution` only.
Please refer to :ref:`BABCHEJD` for information on :ref:`mne_do_forward_solution`.
See :ref:`mne_forward_solution` for command-line options.

Implementation of software gradient compensation
================================================

As described in :ref:`BEHDDFBI` the CTF and 4D Neuroimaging
data may have been subjected to noise cancellation employing the
data from the reference sensor array. Even though these sensor are
rather far away from the brain sources, mne_forward_solution takes
them into account in the computations. If the data file specified
with the ``--meas`` option has software gradient compensation
activated, mne_forward_solution computes
the field of at the reference sensors in addition to the main MEG
sensor array and computes a compensated forward solution using the
methods described in :ref:`BEHDDFBI`.

.. warning:: If a data file specified with the ``--meas`` option    and that used in the actual inverse computations with mne_analyze and mne_make_movie have    different software gradient compensation states., the forward solution    will be in mismatch with the data to be analyzed and the current    estimates will be slightly erroneous.

.. _CHDIAFIG:

The EEG sphere model definition file
====================================

For the computation of the electric potential distribution
on the surface of the head (EEG) it is necessary to define the conductivities
(:math:`\sigma`) and radiuses of the spherically
symmetric layers. Different sphere models can be specified with
the ``--eegmodels`` option.

The EEG sphere model definition files may contain comment
lines starting with a # and model
definition lines in the following format:

 <*name*>: <*radius1*>: <*conductivity1*>: <*radius2*>: <*conductivity2*>:...

When the file is loaded the layers are sorted so that the
radiuses will be in ascending order and the radius of the outermost
layer is scaled to 1.0. The scalp radius specified with the ``--eegrad`` option
is then consulted to scale the model to the correct dimensions.
Even if the model setup file is not present, a model called Default is
always provided. This model has the structure given in :ref:`BABEBGDA`

EEG forward solution in the sphere model
========================================

When the sphere model is employed, the computation of the
EEG solution can be substantially accelerated by using approximation
methods described by Mosher, Zhang, and Berg, see :ref:`CEGEGDEI` (Mosher *et
al.* and references therein). mne_forward_solution approximates
the solution with three dipoles in a homogeneous sphere whose locations
and amplitudes are determined by minimizing the cost function:

.. math::    S(r_1,\dotsc,r_m\ ,\ \mu_1,\dotsc,\mu_m) = \int_{scalp} {(V_{true} - V_{approx})}\,dS

where :math:`r_1,\dotsc,r_m` and :math:`\mu_1,\dotsc,\mu_m` are
the locations and amplitudes of the approximating dipoles and :math:`V_{true}` and :math:`V_{approx}` are
the potential distributions given by the true and approximative
formulas, respectively. It can be shown that this integral can be
expressed in closed form using an expansion of the potentials in
spherical harmonics. The formula is evaluated for the most superficial
dipoles, *i.e.*, those lying just inside the
inner skull surface.

Field derivatives
=================

If the ``--grad`` option is specified, mne_forward_solution includes
the derivatives of the forward solution with respect to the dipole
location coordinates to the output file. Let

.. math::    G_k = [g_{xk} g_{yk} g_{zk}]

be the :math:`N_{chan} \times 3` matrix containing
the signals produced by three orthogonal dipoles at location :math:`r_k` making
up :math:`N_{chan} \times 3N_{source}` the gain matrix

.. math::    G = [G_1 \dotso G_{N_{source}}]\ .

With the ``--grad`` option, the output from mne_forward_solution also
contains the :math:`N_{chan} \times 9N_{source}` derivative matrix

.. math::    D = [D_1 \dotso D_{N_{source}}]\ ,

where

.. math::    D_k = [\frac{\delta g_{xk}}{\delta x_k} \frac{\delta g_{xk}}{\delta y_k} \frac{\delta g_{xk}}{\delta z_k} \frac{\delta g_{yk}}{\delta x_k} \frac{\delta g_{yk}}{\delta y_k} \frac{\delta g_{yk}}{\delta z_k} \frac{\delta g_{zk}}{\delta x_k} \frac{\delta g_{zk}}{\delta y_k} \frac{\delta g_{zk}}{\delta z_k}]\ ,

where :math:`x_k`, :math:`y_k`, and :math:`z_k` are the location
coordinates of the :math:`k^{th}` dipole. If
the dipole orientations are to the cortical normal with the ``--fixed``
option, the dimensions of :math:`G` and :math:`D` are :math:`N_{chan} \times N_{source}` and :math:`N_{chan} \times 3N_{source}`,
respectively. Both :math:`G` and :math:`D` can
be read with the mne_read_forward_solution Matlab
function, see Table 10.1.

Averaging forward solutions
###########################

Purpose
=======

One possibility to make a grand average over several runs
of a experiment is to average the data across runs and average the
forward solutions accordingly. For this purpose, :ref:`mne_average_forward_solutions` computes a
weighted average of several forward solutions. The program averages both
MEG and EEG forward solutions. Usually the EEG forward solution is
identical across runs because the electrode locations do not change.
