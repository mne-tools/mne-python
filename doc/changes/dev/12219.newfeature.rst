Add drop_bad_epochs method to :class:mne.Epochs for channel-specific epoch rejection

This method allows users to mark bad epochs on a per-channel basis by setting 
them to NaN. The 
nave and 
nave_per_channel attributes for evokeds are updated 
accordingly to reflect the number of valid epochs per channel.
