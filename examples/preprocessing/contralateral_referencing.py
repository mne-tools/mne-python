=======================================
Using contralateral referencing for EEG
=======================================

Instead of using a single reference electrode for all channels, some
researchers reference the EEG electrodes in each hemisphere to an electrode in
the contralateral hemisphere (often an electrode over the mastoid bone; this is
common in sleep research for example). Here we demonstrate how to set a
contralateral EEG reference.
