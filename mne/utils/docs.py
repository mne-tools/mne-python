For historical reasons, ``decim`` / "decimation" refers to simply subselecting
samples from a given signal. This contrasts with the broader signal processing
literature, where decimation is defined as (quoting
:footcite:`OppenheimEtAl1999`, p. 172; which cites
:footcite:`CrochiereRabiner1983`):

    "... a general system for downsampling by a factor of M is the one shown
    in Figure 4.23. Such a system is called a decimator, and downsampling
    by lowpass filtering followed by compression [i.e, subselecting samples]
    has been termed decimation (Crochiere and Rabiner, 1983)."

Hence "decimation" in MNE is what is considered "compression" in the signal
processing community.

Decimation can be done multiple times. For example,
``inst.decimate(2).decimate(2)`` will be the same as
``inst.decimate(4)``.

Notes
-----
Some common referencing schemes and the corresponding value for the
``ref_channels`` parameter:

- Average reference:
    A new virtual reference electrode is created by averaging the current
    EEG signal by setting ``ref_channels='average'``. Bad EEG channels are
    automatically excluded if they are properly set in ``info['bads']``.

- A single electrode:
    Set ``ref_channels`` to a list containing the name of the channel that
    will act as the new reference, for example ``ref_channels=['Cz']``.

- The mean of multiple electrodes:
    A new virtual reference electrode is created by computing the average
    of the current EEG signal recorded from two or more selected channels.
    Set ``ref_channels`` to a list of channel names, indicating which
    channels to use. For example, to apply an average mastoid reference,
    when using the 10-20 naming scheme, set ``ref_channels=['M1', 'M2']``.

- REST
    The given EEG electrodes are referenced to a point at infinity using the
    lead fields in ``forward``, which helps standardize the signals.

1. If a reference is requested that is not the average reference, this
   function removes any pre-existing average reference projections.

2. During source localization, the EEG signal should have an average
   reference.

3. In order to apply a reference, the data must be preloaded. This is not
   necessary if ``ref_channels='average'`` and ``projection=True``.

4. For an average or REST reference, bad EEG channels are automatically
   excluded if they are properly set in ``info['bads']``.

    The docstring of the source function is prepepended to the docstring of the
    function wrapped by this decorator. Additionally, the first parameter
    specified in the docstring of the source function is removed in the new
    docstring.

    This decorator is useful when implementing a method that just calls a
    function.  This pattern is prevalent in for example the plotting functions
    of MNE.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : function
        Function to copy the docstring from.

    Returns
    -------
    wrapper : function
        The decorated method.

    Notes
    -----
    The parsing performed is very basic and will break easily on docstrings
    that are not formatted exactly according to the ``numpydoc`` standard.
    Always inspect the resulting docstring when using this decorator.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def plot_function(object, a, b):
    ...     '''Docstring for plotting function.
    ...
    ...     Parameters
    ...     ----------
    ...     object : instance of object
    ...         The object to plot
    ...     a : int
    ...         Some parameter
    ...     b : int
