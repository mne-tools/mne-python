Annotating continuous data
==========================

This tutorial describes adding annotations to a Raw object, and how annotations
are used in later stages of data processing.

As usual we'll start by importing the modules we need, loading some example
data, and cropping it to save memory:
"""

import os
import mne

sample_data_folder = mne.datasets.sample.data_path()
sample_data_raw_file = os.path.join(sample_data_folder, 'MEG', 'sample',
                                    'sample_audvis_raw.fif')
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(sample_data_raw_file, verbose=False)

# :class:`~mne.Annotations` in MNE-Python are a way of storing short strings of
# information about temporal spans of a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object. Below the
# surface, each annotation in an :class:`~mne.Annotations` object is just three
# pieces of information: an ``onset`` time (in seconds), a ``duration`` (also
# in seconds), and a ``description`` (a text string).
#
#
# Creating annotations programmatically
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If you know in advance what spans of the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object you want
# to annotate, :class:`~mne.Annotations` can be created programmatically, and
# you can even pass lists or arrays to the :class:`~mne.Annotations`
# constructor to annotate multiple spans at once:

my_annot = mne.Annotations(onset=[3, 5, 7], duration=[1, 0.5, 0.25],
                           description=['AAA', 'BBB', 'CCC'])
print(my_annot)

###############################################################################
# When you print an :class:`~mne.Annotations` object, you'll notice it has a
# property called ``orig_time``; this gives the time relative to which the
# annotation ``onset`` values are determined. In the example above
# ``orig_time`` is ``None`` (meaning we didn't set it).
#
# Once created, the annotations can be added to a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object
# with the :meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_annotations` method, and then accessed
# through the :attr:`~mne.io.Raw.annotations` attribute:

raw.set_annotations(my_annot)
print(raw.annotations)

###############################################################################
# Notice that now the ``orig_time`` has been updated to match the measurement
# date of the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object (``raw.info['meas_date']``):
# ``2002-12-03 19:01:10.720100``. Below, you can also see that the annotation
# onsets have been adjusted to take ``raw.first_samp`` into account:
#
# .. TODO when raw tutorial updated, add this to end of paragraph:
#    (see :ref:`time-as-index` for more info on ``raw.first_samp``)

print(my_annot.onset)
print(raw.annotations.onset)
print(my_annot.onset + raw.first_samp / raw.info['sfreq'])

###############################################################################
# If that's not what you want, you can set ``orig_time`` before you add the
# annotations object to :class:`~mne.io.Raw`, and the onsets won't get
# adjusted. When you create the annotations object you can set ``orig_time``
# using an `ISO 8601`_ formatted string; here we'll set it at 100 seconds later
# than ``raw.info['meas_date']``:

later_annot = mne.Annotations(onset=[3, 5, 7], duration=[1, 0.5, 0.25],
                              description=['DDD', 'EEE', 'FFF'],
                              orig_time='2002-12-03 19:02:50.720100')
raw2 = raw.copy().set_annotations(later_annot)
print(later_annot.onset)
print(raw2.annotations.onset)

###############################################################################
# .. note::
#
#     If your annotations fall outside the range of data times in the
#     :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object, the annotations outside the data range will
#     not be added to ``raw.annotations``, and a warning will be issued.
#
# Now that your annotations have been added to a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object,
# you can see them when you visualize the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object:

raw.plot(start=2, duration=6)

###############################################################################
# The three annotations appear as differently colored rectangles because they
# have different ``description`` values (which are printed along the top
# edge of the plot area). Notice also that colored spans appear in the small
# scroll bar at the bottom of the plot window, making it easy to quickly view
# where in a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object the annotations are so you can easily
# browse through the data to find and examine them.
#
#
# Annotating :class:`~mne.io.Raw` objects interactively
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Annotations can also be added to a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object interactively
# by clicking-and-dragging the mouse in the plot window. To do this, you must
# first enter "annotation mode" by pressing :kbd:`a` while the plot window is
# focused; this will bring up the annotation controls window:
#
# .. image:: ../../_static/annotation-controls.png
#    :alt: screenshot of MNE-Python annotation controls window
#
# The colored rings are clickable, and determine which existing label will be
# created by the next click-and-drag operation in the main plot window. New
# annotation descriptions can be added by typing the new description,
# clicking the :guilabel:`Add label` button; the new description will be added
# to the list of descriptions and automatically selected.
#
# During interactive annotation it is also possible to adjust the start and end
# times of existing annotations, by clicking-and-dragging on the left or right
# edges of the highlighting rectangle corresponding to that annotation.
#
# .. warning::
#
#     Calling :meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_annotations` **replaces** any annotations
#     currently stored in the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object, so be careful when
#     working with annotations that were created interactively (you could lose
#     a lot of work if you accidentally overwrite your interactive
#     annotations). A good safeguard is to run
#     ``interactive_annot = raw.annotations`` after you finish an interactive
#     annotation session, so that the annotations are stored in a separate
#     variable outside the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object.
#
#
# How annotations affect preprocessing and analysis
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# You may have noticed that the description for new labels in the annotation
# controls window defaults to ``BAD_``. The reason for this is that annotation
# is often used to mark bad temporal spans of data (such as movement artifacts
# or environmental interference that cannot be removed in other ways such as
# projection or filtering). Several MNE-Python operations
# are "annotation aware" and will avoid using data that is annotated with a
# description that begins with "bad" or "BAD"; such operations typically have a
# boolean ``reject_by_annotation`` parameter. Examples of such operations are
# independent components analysis (:class:`mne.preprocessing.ICA`), functions
# for finding heartbeat and blink artifacts
# (:func:`~mne.preprocessing.find_ecg_events`,
# :func:`~mne.preprocessing.find_eog_events`), and creation of epoched data
# from continuous data (:class:`mne.Epochs`).
#
# .. TODO: change "projection" in prev. para to this when tut is ready:
#    :ref:`projection <ssp-tutorial>`
#
#
# Operations on :class:`~mne.Annotations` objects
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# :class:`~mne.Annotations` objects can be combined by simply adding them with
# the ``+`` operator, as long as they share the same ``orig_time``:

new_annot = mne.Annotations(onset=3.75, duration=0.75, description='AAA')
raw.set_annotations(my_annot + new_annot)
raw.plot(start=2, duration=6)

###############################################################################
# Notice that it is possible to create overlapping annotations, even when they
# share the same description. This is *not* possible when annotating
# interactively; click-and-dragging to create a new annotation that overlaps
# with an existing annotation with the same description will cause the old and
# new annotations to be merged.
#
# Individual annotations can be accessed by indexing an
# :class:`~mne.Annotations` object, and subsets of the annotations can be
# achieved by either slicing or indexing with a list, tuple, or array of
# indices:

print(raw.annotations[0])       # just the first annotation
print(raw.annotations[:2])      # the first two annotations
print(raw.annotations[(3, 2)])  # the fourth and third annotations

###############################################################################
# You can also iterate over the annotations within an :class:`~mne.Annotations`
# object:

for ann in raw.annotations:
    descr = ann['description']
    start = ann['onset']
    end = ann['onset'] + ann['duration']
    print(f"'{descr}' goes from {start} to {end}")

###############################################################################
# Note that iterating, indexing and slicing :class:`~mne.Annotations` all
# return a copy, so changes to an indexed, sliced, or iterated element will not
# modify the original :class:`~mne.Annotations` object.

# later_annot WILL be changed, because we're modifying the first element of
# later_annot.onset directly:
later_annot.onset[0] = 99

# later_annot WILL NOT be changed, because later_annot[0] returns a copy
# before the 'onset' field is changed:
later_annot[0]['onset'] = 77

print(later_annot[0]['onset'])

###############################################################################
# :class:`~mne.Annotations` objects have a :meth:`~mne.Annotations.save` method
# which can write :file:`.fif`, :file:`.csv`, and :file:`.txt` formats (the
# format to write is inferred from the file extension in the filename you
# provide). There is a corresponding :func:`~mne.read_annotations` function to
# load them from disk:

raw.annotations.save('saved-annotations.csv')
annot_from_file = mne.read_annotations('saved-annotations.csv')
print(annot_from_file)
