Bugfixes
--------

- Fix bug where an event that occurred only once was excluded in :func:`mne.io.read_raw_egi`, by :newcontrib:`Ping-Keng Jao`. (`#12300 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12300>`__)

- Fix check for dropping all channels in :meth:`mne.io.Raw.drop_channels` and related methods, by :newcontrib:`Farzin Negahbani`. (`#12763 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12763>`__)
- Fix scrolling behavior in :class:`~mne.Report` when clicking on a TOC entry multiple times, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12561 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12561>`__)

- The color scaling of Evoked topomaps added to reports via :meth:`mne.Report.add_evokeds`
  was sometimes sub-optimal if bad channels were present in the data. This has now been fixed
  and should be more consistent with the topomaps shown in the joint plots, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12578 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12578>`__)
- Fix error causing :meth:`mne.Epochs.interpolate_bads` not to work for ``seeg`` channels and fix a single contact on neighboring shafts sometimes being included in interpolation, by `Alex Rockhill`_ (`#12593 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12593>`__)
- Fix bug where :func:`mne.io.read_raw_fil` could not assign bad channels on import, by `George O'Neill`_. (`#12597 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12597>`__)
- Fixed a bug where :meth:`mne.Evoked.animate_topomap` did not work with :func:`mne.preprocessing.compute_current_source_density` - modified data, by `Michal Žák`_. (`#12605 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12605>`__)
- Fix overflow when plotting source estimates where data is all zero (or close to zero), and fix the range of allowed values for the colorbar sliders, by `Marijn van Vliet`_. (`#12612 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12612>`__)
- Fix adding channels to :class:`~mne.time_frequency.EpochsTFR` objects, by `Clemens Brunner`_. (`#12616 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12616>`__)
- Fix for new sklearn metadata routing protocol in decoding search_light, by `Alex Gramfort`_ (`#12620 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12620>`__)
- Fix bug where :func:`mne.time_frequency.csd_multitaper`, :func:`mne.time_frequency.csd_fourier`, :func:`mne.time_frequency.csd_array_multitaper`, and :func:`mne.time_frequency.csd_array_fourier` would return cross-spectral densities with the ``fmin`` and ``fmax`` frequencies missing, by `Thomas Binns`_ (`#12633 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12633>`__)
- Output types of sparse arrays were changed from ``matrix`` to ``array`` in
  :func:`~mne.channels.read_ch_adjacency`, :func:`~mne.channels.find_ch_adjacency`,
  :func:`~mne.stats.combine_adjacency`, :func:`~mne.spatio_temporal_src_adjacency`,
  and related functions to comply with the pending deprecation of ``np.matrix``.
  The returned objects now behave like standard :class:`~numpy.ndarray` objects, and
  in particular ``*`` now operates element-wise instead of performing matrix
  multiplication. You can use ``@`` as a backward compatible matrix multiplication
  for both ``np.matrix`` and ``np.ndarray`` objects, and if a matrix is desired
  the outputs can be cast directly, for example as ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(out)``.
  Changed by `Eric Larson`_. (`#12646 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12646>`__)

- Safeguard loading of ``meas_date`` in :func:`mne.io.read_raw_edf`, by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_. (`#12754 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12754>`__)
- Fix bug in :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter_prepare_emptyroom` where a difference in sampling frequencies between data and emptyroom files was ignored, by `Daniel McCloy`_. (`#12760 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12760>`__)


API changes by deprecation
--------------------------

- A new argument ``events_as_annotations`` has been added to :func:`mne.io.read_raw_egi`
  with a default value of ``False`` that will change to ``True`` in version 1.9, by
  `Scott Huberty`_ and `Eric Larson`_. (`#12300 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12300>`__)
- ``mne.Info.ch_names`` will now return an empty list instead of raising a ``KeyError`` if no channels
  are present, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12583 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12583>`__)
- Documented that :func:`~mne.match_channel_orders` can also work on Epochs, and Evoked objects. Reflecting this, deprecated the ``raws`` parameter in favor of an ``insts`` parameter, by `Stefan Appelhoff`_. (`#12699 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12699>`__)
- The ``block`` argument to :class:`mne.viz.Brain` is deprecated and will be removed in
  1.9, use :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.show` with ``block=True`` instead, by `Eric Larson`_. (`#12719 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12719>`__)
- :func:`mne.datasets.fetch_fsaverage` now returns a :class:`python:pathlib.Path` object
  rather than a string. Support for string concatenation with plus (``+``) is thus
  deprecated and will be removed in 1.9, use the forward-slash ``/`` operator instead,
  by `Eric Larson`_. (`#12771 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12771>`__)


New features
------------

- Added internals to allow modifying single-channel annotations in the Qt
  raw browser, by :newcontrib:`Noah Markowitz`. (`#12669 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12669>`__)
- Adding :meth:`mne.channels.Layout.copy` and :meth:`mne.channels.Layout.pick` to copy and select channels from a :class:`mne.channels.Layout` object. Plotting 2D topographies of evoked responses with :func:`mne.viz.plot_evoked_topo` with both arguments ``layout`` and ``exclude`` now ignores excluded channels from the :class:`mne.channels.Layout`. By `Mathieu Scheltienne`_. (`#12338 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12338>`__)
- In :class:`~mne.Report` you can now easily navigate through images and figures connected to a slider with the left and right arrow keys. Clicking on the slider or respective image will focus the slider, enabling keyboard navigation, by `Richard Höchenberger`_ (`#12556 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12556>`__)
- When plotting EOG and ECG artifact scores for ICA in :meth:`mne.Report.add_ica`,
  the channel names used for artifact detection are now displayed in the titles of
  each respective subplot, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12573 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12573>`__)
- Use ``aseg='auto'`` for :meth:`mne.viz.Brain.add_volume_labels` and :func:`mne.get_montage_volume_labels` to use ``aparc+aseg`` by default or if not present use ``wmparc`` because freesurfer uses ``wmparc`` in the latest version, by `Alex Rockhill`_. (`#12576 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12576>`__)
- The HTML representations of :class:`~mne.io.Raw`, :class:`~mne.Epochs`,
  and :class:`~mne.Evoked` (which you will see e.g. when working with Jupyter Notebooks or
  :class:`~mne.Report`) have been updated to be more consistent and contain
  slightly more information,  by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (:gh:`12624`) (`#12583 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12583>`__)
- When adding :class:`~mne.Evoked` data to a :class:`~mne.Report` via
  :meth:`~mne.Report.add_evokeds`, we now also include an "Info" section
  with some basic summary info, as has already been the case for raw and
  epochs data, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12584 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12584>`__)
- We added new installation variants for a full installation with the PySide6 Qt binding
  (``"mne[full-pyside6]"``), with the PyQt6 binding (``"mne[full-pyqt6]"``, equivalent to
  ``"mne[full]"``), and without any Qt binding (``"mne[full-no-qt]"``), which may be useful
  in certain situations by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12628 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12628>`__)
- Adding argument ``'random'`` to :func:`~mne.epochs.equalize_epoch_counts` and to :meth:`~mne.Epochs.equalize_event_counts` to randomly select epochs or events. By `Mathieu Scheltienne`_. (`#12649 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12649>`__)
- Add new parameter ``ignore_marker_types`` to :func:`~mne.io.read_raw_brainvision` to ignore marker types (and only use marker descriptions) when reading BrainVision files, by `Clemens Brunner`_. (`#12652 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12652>`__)
- Added support for passing ``axes`` to :func:`mne.viz.plot_head_positions` when
  ``mode='field'``, by `Eric Larson`_. (`#12655 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12655>`__)
- The HTML representation of :class:`~mne.Epochs` (visible e.g. in Jupyter or in :class:`~mne.Report`) now
  indicates whether metadata is attached to the epochs, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12686 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12686>`__)
- Montage plots created with :meth:`~mne.channels.DigMontage.plot` now scale both the channel dots *and* channel names with the new ``scale`` parameter. The default is ``scale=1`` (factors less than 1 will scale down, whereas factors greater than 1 will scale up). The previous ``scale_factor`` parameter only affected marker size, and this parameter is now deprecated. By `Clemens Brunner`_. (`#12703 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12703>`__)
- Add :func:`~mne.stats.erp.compute_sme` to compute the analytical standardized measurement error (SME) as a data quality measure for ERP studies, by `Clemens Brunner`_. (`#12707 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12707>`__)
- Use :class:`python:datetime.date` for ``info["subject_info"]["birthday"]`` rather than
  a tuple of ``(year, month, day)`` by `Eric Larson`_. (`#12720 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12720>`__)
- Add default ``spatial_colors="auto"`` to :func:`mne.viz.plot_evoked_white` and
  :meth:`mne.Evoked.plot_white` to enable spatial colors by default, by `Eric Larson`_. (`#12725 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12725>`__)
- :func:`mne.minimum_norm.make_inverse_operator` and related functions now more robustly
  warn if the whitener computed from the noise covariance has an incorrect rank,
  by `Eric Larson`_. (`#12727 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12727>`__)
- When indexing :class:`~mne.Epochs` (e.g. by doing ``epochs[0]``), static code analysis tools like Pylance
  should now be able to infer that the returned object is an epoch, too, and provide editor support
  like automated code completions, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12733 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12733>`__)
- When using the ``data_path()`` in any dataset included in :py:mod:`mne.datasets`,
  static analysis tools like Pylance will now correctly infer that a `pathlib.Path` will
  be returned and provide editor support like automated code completions, by `Richard Höchenberger`_. (`#12734 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12734>`__)
- Add support for storing Fourier coefficients in :class:`mne.time_frequency.Spectrum`,
  :class:`mne.time_frequency.EpochsSpectrum`, :class:`mne.time_frequency.SpectrumArray`,
  and :class:`mne.time_frequency.EpochsSpectrumArray` objects, by `Thomas Binns`_. (`#12747 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12747>`__)
