    are above/below a certain threshold. Returns a list of 2-tuples.

    When doing a two-tailed test (tail == 0), only points with the same
    sign will be clustered together.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : 1D array
        Data
    threshold : float | dict
        Where to threshold the statistic. Should be negative for tail == -1,
        and positive for tail == 0 or 1. Can also be an dict for
        threshold-free cluster enhancement.
    tail : -1 | 0 | 1
        Type of comparison
    connectivity : sparse matrix in COO format, None, or list
        Defines connectivity between features. The matrix is assumed to
        be symmetric and only the upper triangular half is used.
        If connectivity is a list, it is assumed that each entry stores the
        indices of the spatial neighbors in a spatio-temporal dataset x.
        Default is None, i.e, a regular lattice connectivity.
    max_step : int
        If connectivity is a list, this defines the maximal number of steps
        between vertices along the second dimension (typically time) to be
        considered connected.
    include : 1D bool array or None
        Mask to apply to the data of points to cluster. If None, all points
        are used.
    partitions : array of int or None
        An array (same size as X) of integers indicating which points belong
        to each partition.
    t_power : float
        Power to raise the statistical values (usually t-values) by before
        summing (sign will be retained). Note that t_power == 0 will give a
        count of nodes in each cluster, t_power == 1 will weight each node by
        its statistical score.
    show_info : bool
        If True, display information about thresholds used (for TFCE). Should
        only be done for the standard permutation.

    Returns
    -------
    clusters : list of slices or list of arrays (boolean masks)
        We use slices for 1D signals and mask to multidimensional
        arrays.
    sums: array
        Sum of x values in clusters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array
        Array to return t-values for.
    sigma : float
        The variance estate will be given by "var + sigma * max(var)" or
        "var + sigma", depending on "method". By default this is 0 (no
        adjustment). See Notes for details.
    method : str
        If 'relative', the minimum variance estimate will be sigma * max(var),
        if 'absolute' the minimum variance estimate will be sigma.

    Returns
    -------
    t : array
        t-values, potentially adjusted using the hat method.

    Notes
    -----
    One can use the conversion:

        threshold = -scipy.stats.distributions.t.ppf(p_thresh, n_samples - 1)

    to convert a desired p-value threshold to t-value threshold. Don't forget
    that for two-tailed tests, p_thresh in the above should be divided by 2.

    To use the "hat" adjustment method, a value of sigma=1e-3 may be a
    reasonable choice. See Ridgway et al. 2012 "The problem of low variance
    voxels in statistical parametric mapping; a new hat avoids a 'haircut'",

    For a list of nd-arrays of data, e.g. 2d for time series or 3d for
    time-frequency power values, calculate some statistics corrected for
    multiple comparisons using permutations and cluster level correction.
    Each element of the list X contains the data for one group of
    observations. Randomized data are generated with random partitions
    of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : list
        List of nd-arrays containing the data. Each element of X contains
        the samples for one group. First dimension of each element is the
        number of samples/observations in this group. The other dimensions
        are for the size of the observations. For example if X = [X1, X2]
        with X1.shape = (20, 50, 4) and X2.shape = (17, 50, 4) one has
        2 groups with respectively 20 and 17 observations in each.
        Each data point is of shape (50, 4).
    threshold : float | dict | None
        If threshold is None, it will choose a t-threshold equivalent to
        p < 0.05 for the given number of (within-subject) observations.
        If a dict is used, then threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE)
        will be used.
    n_permutations : int
        The number of permutations to compute.
    tail : -1 or 0 or 1 (default = 0)
        If tail is 1, the statistic is thresholded above threshold.
        If tail is -1, the statistic is thresholded below threshold.
        If tail is 0, the statistic is thresholded on both sides of
        the distribution.
    stat_fun : callable
        function called to calculate statistics, must accept 1d-arrays as
        arguments (default: scipy.stats.f_oneway).
    connectivity : sparse matrix.
        Defines connectivity between features. The matrix is assumed to
        be symmetric and only the upper triangular half is used.
        Default is None, i.e, a regular lattice connectivity.
    verbose : bool, str, int, or None
        If not None, override default verbose level (see mne.verbose).
    n_jobs : int
        Number of permutations to run in parallel (requires joblib package).
    seed : int or None
        Seed the random number generator for results reproducibility.
    max_step : int
        When connectivity is a n_vertices x n_vertices matrix, specify the
        maximum number of steps between vertices along the second dimension
        (typically time) to be considered connected. This is not used for full
        or None connectivity matrices.
    exclude : boolean array or None
        Mask to apply to the data to exclude certain points from clustering
        (e.g., medial wall vertices). Should be the same shape as X. If None,
        no points are excluded.
    step_down_p : float
        To perform a step-down-in-jumps test, pass a p-value for clusters to
        exclude from each successive iteration. Default is zero, perform no
        step-down test (since no clusters will be smaller than this value).
        Setting this to a reasonable value, e.g. 0.05, can increase sensitivity
        but costs computation time.
    t_power : float
        Power to raise the statistical values (usually f-values) by before
        summing (sign will be retained). Note that t_power == 0 will give a
        count of nodes in each cluster, t_power == 1 will weight each node by
        its statistical score.
    out_type : str
        For arrays with connectivity, this sets the output format for clusters.
        If 'mask', it will pass back a list of boolean mask arrays.
        If 'indices', it will pass back a list of lists, where each list is the
        set of vertices in a given cluster. Note that the latter may use far
        less memory for large datasets.
    check_disjoint : bool
        If True, the connectivity matrix (or list) will be examined to
        determine of it can be separated into disjoint sets. In some cases
        (usually with connectivity as a list and many "time" points), this
        can lead to faster clustering, but results should be identical.
    buffer_size: int or None
        The statistics will be computed for blocks of variables of size
        "buffer_size" at a time. This is option significantly reduces the
        memory requirements when n_jobs > 1 and memory sharing between
        processes is enabled (see set_cache_dir()), as X will be shared
        between processes and each process only needs to allocate space
        for a small block of variables.

    Returns
    -------
    T_obs : array of shape [n_tests]
        T-statistic observed for all variables.
    clusters : list
        List type defined by out_type above.
    cluster_pv : array
        P-value for each cluster
    H0 : array of shape [n_permutations]
        Max cluster level stats observed under permutation.

    """Non-parametric cluster-level test for spatio-temporal data

    This function provides a convenient wrapper for data organized in the form
    (observations x time x space) to use permutation_cluster_test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: list of arrays
        Array of shape (observations, time, vertices) in each group.
    threshold: float
        The threshold for the statistic.
    n_permutations: int
        See permutation_cluster_test.
    tail : -1 or 0 or 1 (default = 0)
        See permutation_cluster_test.
    stat_fun : function
        function called to calculate statistics, must accept 1d-arrays as
        arguments (default: scipy.stats.f_oneway)
    connectivity : sparse matrix or None
        Defines connectivity between features. The matrix is assumed to
        be symmetric and only the upper triangular half is used.
        Default is None, i.e, a regular lattice connectivity.
    verbose : bool, str, int, or None
        If not None, override default verbose level (see mne.verbose).
    n_jobs : int
        Number of permutations to run in parallel (requires joblib package).
    seed : int or None
        Seed the random number generator for results reproducibility.
    max_step : int
        When connectivity is a n_vertices x n_vertices matrix, specify the
        maximum number of steps between vertices along the second dimension
        (typically time) to be considered connected. This is not used for full
        or None connectivity matrices.
    spatial_exclude : list of int or None
        List of spatial indices to exclude from clustering.
    step_down_p : float
        To perform a step-down-in-jumps test, pass a p-value for clusters to
        exclude from each successive iteration. Default is zero, perform no
        step-down test (since no clusters will be smaller than this value).
        Setting this to a reasonable value, e.g. 0.05, can increase sensitivity
        but costs computation time.
    t_power : float
        Power to raise the statistical values (usually f-values) by before
        summing (sign will be retained). Note that t_power == 0 will give a
        count of nodes in each cluster, t_power == 1 will weight each node by
        its statistical score.
    out_type : str
        For arrays with connectivity, this sets the output format for clusters.
        If 'mask', it will pass back a list of boolean mask arrays.
        If 'indices', it will pass back a list of lists, where each list is the
        set of vertices in a given cluster. Note that the latter may use far
        less memory for large datasets.
    check_disjoint : bool
        If True, the connectivity matrix (or list) will be examined to
        determine of it can be separated into disjoint sets. In some cases
        (usually with connectivity as a list and many "time" points), this
        can lead to faster clustering, but results should be identical.
    buffer_size: int or None
        The statistics will be computed for blocks of variables of size
        "buffer_size" at a time. This is option significantly reduces the
        memory requirements when n_jobs > 1 and memory sharing between
        processes is enabled (see set_cache_dir()), as X will be shared
        between processes and each process only needs to allocate space
        for a small block of variables.

    Returns
    -------
    T_obs : array of shape [n_tests]
        T-statistic observed for all variables
    clusters : list
        List type defined by out_type above.
    cluster_pv: array
        P-value for each cluster
    H0 : array of shape [n_permutations]
        Max cluster level stats observed under permutation.
