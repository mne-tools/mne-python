`MNE-Python <https://martinos.org/mne>`_
========================================

MNE-Python is an open-source Python package for exploring, visualizing, and
analyzing human neurophysiological data such as MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, and more.
It includes modules for data input/output, preprocessing, visualization, source
estimation, time-frequency analysis, connectivity analysis, machine learning,
and statistics.


Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Documentation for MNE-Python is available at the
`MNE homepage <https://martinos.org/mne>`_.


Get the latest code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get the latest code using `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, open a terminal and type:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python.git

Alternatively, you can also download a
`zip file of the latest development version <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/archive/master.zip>`_.


Installing MNE-Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install the latest stable version of MNE-Python, you can use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U mne

For more complete instructions and more advanced installation methods (e.g. for
the latest development version), see the
`getting started page <https://martinos.org/mne/getting_started.html>`_.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The minimum required dependencies to run MNE-Python are:

- Python >= 2.7
- NumPy >= 1.8
- SciPy >= 0.12
- Matplotlib >= 1.3

For full functionality, some functions require:

- Scikit-learn >= 0.15 (>= 0.18 recommended)
- NiBabel >= 2.1.0
- Pandas >= 0.13
- Picard >= 0.3

To use `NVIDIA CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone>`_ for resampling
and FFT FIR filtering, you will also need to install the NVIDIA CUDA SDK,
pycuda, and scikit-cuda (see the
`getting started page <https://martinos.org/mne/getting_started.html>`_
for more information).
