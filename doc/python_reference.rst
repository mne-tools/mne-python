Python API Reference
====================

This is the reference for classes (``CamelCase`` names) and functions
(``underscore_case`` names) of MNE-Python, grouped thematically by analysis
stage. Functions and classes that are not
below a module heading are found in the ``mne`` namespace.

MNE-Python also provides multiple command-line scripts that can be called
directly from a terminal, see :ref:`python_commands`.
