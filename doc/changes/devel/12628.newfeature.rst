We added new installation variants for a full installation with the PySide6 Qt binding
(``"mne[full-pyside6]"``), with the PyQt6 binding (``"mne[full-pyqt6]"``, equivalent to
``"mne[full]"``), and without any Qt binding (``"mne[full-no-qt]"``), which may be useful
in certain situations by `Richard HÃ¶chenberger`_.
