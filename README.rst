`MNE-Python <http://mne-tools.github.io/>`_
=======================================================

This package is designed for sensor- and source-space analysis of [M/E]EG
data, including frequency-domain and time-frequency analyses, MVPA/decoding
and non-parametric statistics. This package generally evolves quickly and
user contributions can easily be incorporated thanks to the open
development environment .
