Import single subject from LIMO data set into MNE-Python
========================================================

Here we a define function to extract the eeg signal data
from the LIMO structures in the LIMO dataset, see [1]_, [2]_, and:

    https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2189?show=full

    https://github.com/LIMO-EEG-Toolbox

The code allows to:

Fetch single subjects epochs data for the LIMO data set.
Epochs information (i.e., sampling rate, number of epochs per condition,
number and name of EEG channels per subject, etc.) is extracted from
the LIMO .mat files stored on disk.
If files are not found, the function mne.datasets.limo.load_data() will
automatically download the data from a remote repository.

mne.datasets.limo.load_data() creates a custom info and
epochs structure in MNE-Python.
Missing channels can be interpolated if desired.

# In the original LIMO experiment, participants performed a two-alternative
# forced choice task discriminating between the same two faces.
# The critical manipulation in the experiment was that the phase-coherence of
# the presented face-stimuli was varied across a noise-signal continuum
# spanning from 0 to 100 %. In other words, faces with high phase coherence
# were easily discernible, while faces with low phase-coherence were hard to
# identify as such).
# The events coding the presentation of each of these two faces are stored in
# ``limo_epochs.events``.
#
# We can visualise the distribution of the face events contained in the
# epochs structure. Events should appear clearly grouped, as they are ordered
# during the import process.

###############################################################################
# As it can be seen above, events are coded as ``Face/A`` and ``Face/B``.
# Information about the phase-coherence of the presented faces is stored in
# ``limo_epochs.metadata``, which also contains information about the presented
# faces for convenience.
#
# Check epochs metadata

# Before going on, we'll drop the EOG channels present in the LIMO epochs
# (coded with EXG-prefix in ``limo_epochs.info['ch_names']``, as data has
# already been cleaned.
limo_epochs.drop_channels(['EXG1', 'EXG2', 'EXG3', 'EXG4'])

# Furthermore, some datasets contain missing channels (stored in

# data. We’ll interpolate this channels for convenience.

# As expected, no see clear differential patterns appears when contrasting

# Next, we can inspect the effect of phase-coherence on the activation
# patterns evoked by the presented face-stimuli.
