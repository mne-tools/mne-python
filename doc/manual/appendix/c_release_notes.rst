were added.

mne_convert_surface
-------------------

The functionality of mne_convert_dfs was
integrated into mne_convert_surface .
Text output as a triangle file and and file file containing the
list of vertex points was added. The Matlab output option was removed.
Consequently,  mne_convert_dfs , mne_surface2mat ,
and mne_list_surface_nodes were
deleted from the distribution.

mne_dump_triggers
-----------------

This obsolete utility was deleted from the distribution.

mne_epochs2mat
--------------

The name of the digital trigger channel can be specified
with the MNE_TRIGGER_CH_NAME environment variable. Added
the ``--digtrigmask`` option.

Include the Talairach transformations from the FreeSurfer data to
the output file if possible.

mne_make_movie
--------------

Added the ``--noscalebar``, ``--nocomments``, ``--morphgrade``, ``--rate``,
and ``--pickrange`` options.

mne_make_source_space
---------------------

The ``--spacing`` option is now implemented in this
program, which means mne_mris_trix is
now obsolete. The mne_setup_source_space script
was modified accordingly. Support for tri, dec, and dip files was dropped.

Matlab toolbox
--------------

Several new functions were added, see :ref:`ch_matlab`.

.. note:: The matlab function fiff_setup_read_raw has    a significant change. The sample numbers now take into account possible    initial skip in the file, *i.e.*, the time between    the start of the data acquisition and the start of saving the data    to disk. The first_samp member    of the returned structure indicates the initial skip in samples.    If you want your own routines, which assume that initial skip has    been removed, perform indentically with the previous version, subtract first_samp from    the sample numbers you specify to fiff_read_raw_segment .    Furthermore, fiff_setup_read_raw has    an optional argument to allow reading of unprocessed MaxShield data acquired    with the Elekta MEG systems.

one data file to another.

Release notes for MNE software 2.7
##################################

Software engineering
====================

There have been two significant changes in the software engineering
since MNE Version 2.6:

- CMake is now used in building the software
  package and

- Subversion (SVN) is now used for revision control instead
  of Concurrent Versions System (CVS).

These changes have the effects on the distribution of the
MNE software and setup for individual users:

- There is now a separate software package
  for each of the platforms supported.

- The software is now organized completely under standard directories (bin,
  lib, and share). In particular, the directory setup/mne has been moved
  to share/mne and the directories app-defaults and doc are now under
  share. All files under share are platform independent.

- The use of shared libraries has been minimized. This alleviates
  compatibility problems across operating system versions.

- The setup scripts have changed.

The installation and user-level effects of the new software
organization are discussed in :ref:`getting_started`.

In addition, several minor bugs have been fixed in the source
code. Most relevant changes visible to the user are listed below.

Matlab tools
============

- The performance of the fiff I/O routines
  has been significantly improved thanks to the contributions of François
  Tadel at USC.

- Label file I/O routines mne_read_label_file and mne_write_label_file as
  well as a routine to extract time courses corresponding to a label from
  an stc file (mne_label_time_courses) have been added.

- The patch information is now read from the source space file
  and included in the source space data structure.

mne_browse_raw
==============

- Rejection criteria to detect flat channels
  have been added.

- Possibility to detect temporal skew between trigger input
  lines has been added.

- ``--allowmaxshield`` option now works in the batch mode as well.

- Added the ``--projevent`` option to batch mode.

- It is now possible to compute an SSP operator for EEG.

mne_analyze
===========

- Both hemispheres can now be displayed
  simultaneously.

- If the source space was created with mne_make_source_space version 2.3
  or later, the subject's surface data are automatically
  loaded after loading the data and the inverse operator.

Miscellaneous
=============

- mne_smooth_w was
  renamed to mne_smooth and can
  now handle both w and stc files. Say ``mne_smooth --help`` to
  find the options.

- All binaries now reside in $MNE_ROOT/bin. There are no separate bin/mne
  and bin/admin directories.

- mne_anonymize now has the
  ``--his`` option to remove the HIS ID of the subject.

- mne_check_surface now has
  the ``--bem`` and ``--id`` options to check surfaces from a BEM fif file.

- mne_compute_raw_inverse now has the ``--orignames`` option.

- Added ``--headcoord`` option to mne_convert_dig_data.

- Added ``--talairach`` option to mne_make_cor_set.

- Added the ``--morph`` option to mne_setup_source_space and mne_make_source_space.

- Added the ``--prefix`` option to mne_morph_labels.

- Added the ``--blocks`` and ``--indent`` options to mne_show_fiff.

- Added the ``--proj`` option as well as map types 5 and 6 to mne_sensitivity_map.

- Fixed a bug in mne_inverse_operator which
  caused erroneous calculation of EEG-only source estimates if the
  data were processed with Maxfilter software and sometimes caused
  similar behavior on MEG/EEG source estimates.
