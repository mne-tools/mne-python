class Calibration(dict):
    """Eye-tracking calibration info.

    This data structure behaves like a dictionary. It contains information regarding a
    calibration that was conducted during an eye-tracking recording.

    .. note::
        When possible, a Calibration instance should be created with a helper function,
        such as :func:`~mne.preprocessing.eyetracking.read_eyelink_calibration`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    onset : float
        The onset of the calibration in seconds. If the calibration was
        performed before the recording started, the the onset can be
        negative.
    model : str
        A string, which is the model of the eye-tracking calibration that was applied.
        For example ``'H3'`` for a horizontal only 3-point calibration, or ``'HV3'``
        for a horizontal and vertical 3-point calibration.
    eye : str
        The eye that was calibrated. For example, ``'left'``, or ``'right'``.
    avg_error : float
        The average error in degrees between the calibration positions and the
        actual gaze position.
    max_error : float
        The maximum error in degrees that occurred between the calibration
        positions and the actual gaze position.
    positions : array-like of float, shape ``(n_calibration_points, 2)``
        The x and y coordinates of the calibration points.
    offsets : array-like of float, shape ``(n_calibration_points,)``
        The error in degrees between the calibration position and the actual
        gaze position for each calibration point.
    gaze : array-like of float, shape ``(n_calibration_points, 2)``
        The x and y coordinates of the actual gaze position for each calibration point.
    screen_size : array-like of shape ``(2,)``
        The width and height (in meters) of the screen that the eyetracking
        data was collected with. For example ``(.531, .298)`` for a monitor with
        a display area of 531 x 298 mm.
    screen_distance : float
        The distance (in meters) from the participant's eyes to the screen.
    screen_resolution : array-like of shape ``(2,)``
        The resolution (in pixels) of the screen that the eyetracking data
        was collected with. For example, ``(1920, 1080)`` for a 1920x1080
        resolution display.
