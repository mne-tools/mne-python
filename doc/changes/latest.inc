Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Add dbs as new channel type for deep brain stimulation (DBS) recordings (:gh:`8739` **by new contributor** |Richard Koehler|_)

- Add :func:`mne.chpi.extract_chpi_locs_kit` to read cHPI coil locations from KIT/Yokogawa data (:gh:`` **by new contributor** |Matt Sanderson|_, `Robert Seymour`_, and `Eric Larson`_)

- Add ``auto_close`` to `mne.Report.add_figs_to_section` and `mne.Report.add_slider_to_section` to manage closing figures (:gh`8730` by `Guillaume Favelier`_)

- Add :func:`mne.write_head_bem` to support writing head surface files (:gh:`8841` by `Yu-Han Luo`_)

- The signal of ``resp`` (respiratory) channels is now assumed to be in the unit Volt  (:gh:`8858` by `Richard Höchenberger`_)

- Static type checkers like Pylance (comes with VS Code) now display the parameters of many more functions correctly, largely improving overall usability for VS Code users (:gh:`8862` by `Richard Höchenberger`_)

- Support new EEGLAB file format (:gh:`8874` by `Clemens Brunner`_)

- Reading and writing FIFF files whose filenames end with ``_meg.fif.gz``, ``_eeg.fif(.gz)``, and ``_ieeg.fif(.gz)`` doesn't emit a warning anymore; this improves interobaility with BIDS-formatted datasets (:gh:`8868` by `Richard Höchenberger`_)
