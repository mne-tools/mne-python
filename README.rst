`mne-python <http://martinos.org/mne/mne-python.html>`_
=======================================================

This package is designed for sensor- and source-space analysis of M-EEG
data, including frequency-domain and time-frequency analyses and
non-parametric statistics. This package is presently evolving quickly and
thanks to the adopted open development environment user contributions can
be easily incorporated.

Get more information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page only contains bare-bones instructions for installing mne-python.

If you're familiar with MNE and you're looking for information on using
mne-python specifically, jump right to the `mne-python homepage
<http://martinos.org/mne/mne-python.html>`_. This website includes a
`tutorial <http://martinos.org/mne/python_tutorial.html>`_,
helpful `examples <http://martinos.org/mne/auto_examples/index.html>`_, and
a handy `function reference <http://martinos.org/mne/python_reference.html>`_,
among other things.

If you're unfamiliar with MNE, you can visit the
`MNE homepage <http://martinos.org/mne>`_ for full user documentation.

Get the latest code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get the latest code using git, simply type::

    git clone git://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python.git

If you don't have git installed, you can download a zip or tarball
of the latest code: http://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/archives/master

Install mne-python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As any Python packages, to install MNE-Python, go in the mne-python source
code directory and do::

    python setup.py install

or if you don't have admin access to your python setup (permission denied
when install) use::

    python setup.py install --user

You can also install the latest release version with easy_install::

    easy_install -U mne

or with pip::

    pip install mne --upgrade

or for the latest development version (the most up to date)::

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python#egg=mne-dev --user

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The required dependencies to build the software are python >= 2.6,
NumPy >= 1.6, SciPy >= 0.7.2 and matplotlib >= 0.98.4.

Some isolated functions require pandas >= 0.7.3 and nitime (multitaper analysis).

To run the tests you will also need nose >= 0.10.
and the MNE sample dataset (will be downloaded automatically
when you run an example ... but be patient)

To use NVIDIA CUDA for FFT FIR filtering, you will also need to install
the NVIDIA CUDA SDK, pycuda, and scikits.cuda. The difficulty of this varies
by platform; consider reading the following site for help getting pycuda
to work (typically the most difficult to configure):

Running the test suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the test suite, you need nosetests and the coverage modules.
Run the test suite using::

    nosetests

from the root of the project.

Making a release and uploading it to PyPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command is only run by project manager, to make a release, and
upload in to PyPI::

    python setup.py sdist bdist_egg register upload
