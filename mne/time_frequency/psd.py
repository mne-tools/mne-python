    """
    Calculate various forms of windowed FFTs for PSD.

    This is a helper function that was adapted from scipy.
    It is not designed to be called externally. The windows are not averaged
    over; the result from each window is returned.

    Parameters
    ---------
    x : array_like
        Array or sequence containing the data to be analyzed.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency of the time series. Defaults to 1.0.
    window : str or tuple or array_like, optional
        Desired window to use. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length will be used for nperseg.
        Defaults to 'hann'.
    nperseg : int, optional
        Length of each segment.  Defaults to 256.
    noverlap : int, optional
        Number of points to overlap between segments. If None,
        ``noverlap = nperseg // 2``.  Defaults to None.
    nfft : int, optional
        Length of the FFT used, if a zero padded FFT is desired.  If None,
        the FFT length is `nperseg`. Defaults to None.
    detrend : str or function or False, optional
        Specifies how to detrend each segment. If `detrend` is a string,
        it is passed as the ``type`` argument to `detrend`.  If it is a
        function, it takes a segment and returns a detrended segment.
        If `detrend` is False, no detrending is done.  Defaults to 'constant'.
    scaling : { 'density', 'spectrum' }, optional
        Selects between computing the cross spectral density ('density')
        where `Pxy` has units of V**2/Hz and computing the cross spectrum
        ('spectrum') where `Pxy` has units of V**2, if `x` and `y` are
        measured in V and fs is measured in Hz.  Defaults to 'density'
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the periodogram is computed; the default is over
        the last axis (i.e. ``axis=-1``).

    Returns
    -------
    freqs : ndarray
        Array of sample frequencies.
    t : ndarray
        Array of times corresponding to each data segment
    result : ndarray
        Array of output data.

    Adapted from scipy.signal.spectral which was in turn adapted from

    Differences with respect to `scipy.signal.spectral._spectral_helper`:
    * only one data argument - x instead of x and y, because csd is not
      computed
    * sampling frequency (`fs`) is no longer optional
    * always returns one-sided spectrum thus `return_onesided` arg is gone
    * use 'density' scaling by default (this is the default for
