        ([MWE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example))
        to replicate your problem, using one of the
        [datasets shipped with MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/dev/overview/datasets_index.html),
        preferably the one called [sample](https://mne.tools/dev/overview/datasets_index.html#sample).
        If you can't replicate on a built-in dataset, provide also a link to a small,
        anonymized portion of your data that does yield the error.
