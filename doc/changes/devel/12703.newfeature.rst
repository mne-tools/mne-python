Montage plots created with :meth:`~mne.channels.DigMontage.plot` now scale both the channel dots *and* channel names with the new ``scale`` parameter. The default is ``scale=1`` (factors less than 1 will scale down, whereas factors greater than 1 will scale up). The previous ``scale_factor`` parameter only affected marker size, and this parameter is now deprecated. By `Clemens Brunner`_.
