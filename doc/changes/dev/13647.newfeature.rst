Add finer-grained control to :func:`mne.io.anonymize_info` and the related methods :meth:`mne.io.Raw.anonymize`, :meth:`mne.Epochs.anonymize`, and :meth:`mne.Evoked.anonymize` by allowing ``keep_his`` to accept one or more strings; ``keep_his=True`` remains unchanged (retaining ``"his_id"``, ``"sex"``, and ``"hand"`` from anonymization), but individual fields can now also be retained (the default ``keep_his=False`` also remains unchanged and still anonymizes all fields), by `Clemens Brunner`_.
