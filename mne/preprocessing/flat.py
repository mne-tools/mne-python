def mark_flat(raw, ratio=1., min_duration=0.005, picks=None, verbose=None):
    r"""Mark flat segments of raw data using annotations or in info['bads'].

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : instance of Raw
        The raw data.
    ratio : float
        The ratio of the temporal proportion (time spent flat) to spatial
        proportion (the reciprocal of the number of channels in picks)
        below which temporal bad marking (:class:`~mne.Annotations`) will be
        used instead of spatial bad marking (:class:`info['bads'] <mne.Info>`).
        See Notes.
    min_duration : float
        The minimum duration (sec) to consider as actually flat.
        For some systems with low bit data representations, adjacent
        channels with exactly the same value are not totally uncommon.

    Returns
    -------
    raw : instance of Raw
        The modified raw instance. Operates in place.

    Notes
    -----
    For a given channel :math:`i` in `picks` that is flat (considering only
    flat segments of at least `min_duration`)
    for :math:`p_{i,t}` proportion of time points, given the spatial fraction
    of picks that the channel represents (constant
    :math:`p_{i,s} = 1 / N_\mathrm{picks}`), the `ratio`
    parameter sets the ratio :math:`\frac{p_{i,t}}{p_{i,s}}` below which
    temporal marking (:class:`~mne.Annotations`) will be used instead of
    spatial marking (:clasS:`~mne.Info`). Or more simply:

    - ``ratio < 1. / len(picks)`` always marks temporally.
        - This risks the entire recording being marked bad if there is
          (at least) one channel that is flat at all times.
    - ``1. / len(picks) <= ratio < len(picks)`` marks spatially or temporally.
        - Values in the range ``0 < ratio < 1`` prefer temporal marking to
          spatial marking.
        - The default value ``ratio = 1.`` uses the temporal method
          if and only if the proportion of time a given channel is flat is
          less than the reciprocal of the number of channels in ``picks``.
        - Values in the range ``1 < ratio < len(picks)`` prefer spatial
          marking to temporal marking.
    - ``ratio >= len(picks)`` always marks spatially.
        - This risks a channel being marked as bad for the entire recording if
          it is flat for a contiguous `min_duration` chunk of time.

    .. note:: This function may perform much faster if data are loaded
              in memory, as it loads data one channel at a time (across all
              time points), which is typically not an efficient way to read
              raw data from disk.
