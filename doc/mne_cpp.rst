MNE with CPP
======================

MNE-CPP is a cross-platform application and algorithm C++ framework for
MEG and EEG data analysis and acquisition. It provides a modular
structure with many sub-libraries. These libraries can be easily
integrated into your project to, e.g. provide full I/O support for the
FIF-file format or files generated by the MNE suite. MNE-CPP comes with
its own acquisition software, MNE-X, which can be used to acquire and
process data from Elekta Neuromag MEG VectorView, BabyMEG,
TMSI EEG and eegosports.
