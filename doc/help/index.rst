Getting help
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are several places to obtain help with MNE software tools.

- The `MNE Forum`_ is a good placed to go for both troubleshooting and general
  questions.
- The :ref:`faq` page has some troubleshooting tips, and is a good source of
  general information. There are also some troubleshooting tips built into
  the :ref:`Python <install-python>` and
  :ref:`MNE-Python <standard-instructions>` installation pages (look for the
  |hand-paper| symbols), and some tips related to 3D plotting problems on
  :ref:`the advanced setup page <troubleshoot_3d>`.
- If you want to request new features or if you're confident that you have
  found a bug, please create a new issue on the `GitHub issues page`_.
  When reporting bugs, please try to replicate the bug with the MNE-Python
  :ref:`sample data <sample-dataset>`, and make every effort to simplify your
  example script to only the elements necessary to replicate the bug.
