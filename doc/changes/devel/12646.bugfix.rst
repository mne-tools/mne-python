Output types of sparse arrays were changed from ``matrix`` to ``array`` in
:func:`~mne.channels.read_ch_adjacency`, :func:`~mne.channels.find_ch_adjacency`,
:func:`~mne.stats.combine_adjacency`, :func:`~mne.spatio_temporal_src_adjacency`,
and related functions to comply with the pending deprecation of ``np.matrix``.
The returned objects now behave like standard :class:`~numpy.ndarray` objects, and
in particular ``*`` now operates element-wise instead of performing matrix
multiplication. You can use ``@`` as a backward compatible matrix multiplication
for both ``np.matrix`` and ``np.ndarray`` objects, and if a matrix is desired
the outputs can be cast directly, for example as ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix(out)``.
Changed by `Eric Larson`_.
