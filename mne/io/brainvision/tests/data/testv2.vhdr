[User Infos]
; Each entry: Prop<Number>=<Type>,<Name>,<Value>,<Value2>,...,<ValueN>
; Property number must be unique. Types can be int, single, string, bool, byte, double, uint
; or arrays of those, indicated int-array etc
; Array types have more than one value, number of values determines size of array.
; Fields are delimited by commas, commas in strings are written \1

; Each entry: Ch<Channel number>=<Name>,<Reference channel name>,
; <Resolution in "Unit">,<Unit>, Future extensions..
; Fields are delimited by commas, some fields might be omitted (empty).
