.. NOTE: we use cross-references to highlight new functions and classes.
   Please follow the examples below like :func:`mne.stats.f_mway_rm`, so the
   whats_new page will have a link to the function/class documentation.

.. NOTE: there are 3 separate sections for changes, based on type:
   - "Enhancements" for new features
   - "Bugs" for bug fixes
   - "API changes" for backward-incompatible changes

.. NOTE: changes from first-time contributors should be added to the TOP of
   the relevant section (Enhancements / Bugs / API changes), and should look
   like this (where xxxx is the pull request number):

       - description of enhancement/bugfix/API change (:gh:`xxxx` by
         :newcontrib:`Firstname Lastname`)

   Also add a corresponding entry for yourself in doc/changes/names.inc
