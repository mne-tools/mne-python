Improved sklearn class compatibility and compliance, which resulted in some parameters of classes having an underscore appended to their name during ``fit``, such as:

- :class:`mne.decoding.FilterEstimator` parameter ``picks`` passed to the initializer is set as ``est.picks_``
- :class:`mne.decoding.UnsupervisedSpatialFilter` parameter ``estimator`` passed to the initializer is set as ``est.estimator_``

Unused ``verbose`` class parameters (that had no effect) were removed from :class:`~mne.decoding.PSDEstimator`, :class:`~mne.decoding.TemporalFilter`, and :class:`~mne.decoding.FilterEstimator` as well.
Changes by `Eric Larson`_.
