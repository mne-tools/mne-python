"""
Event API for inter-figure communication.

The event API allows figures to communicate with each other, such that a change
in one figure can trigger a change in another figure. For example, moving the
time cursor in one plot can update the current time in another plot. Another
scenario is two drawing routines drawing into the same window, using events to
stay in-sync.
