MNE-Python installers
=====================

MNE-Python installers are the easiest way to install MNE-Python and
all dependencies. They also provide many additional
Python packages and tools, including the `Spyder`_ development environment.
Got any questions? Let us know on the `MNE Forum`_!

First steps
^^^^^^^^^^^

The installer adds menu entries on Linux and Windows, and several application
bundles to the ``Applications`` folder on macOS.

.. rst-class:: list-unstyled
.. rst-class:: mx-5
.. rst-class:: mt-4
.. rst-class:: mb-5

- |code| |ensp| Use **Spyder** to start writing your own analysis scripts right away, or to run one of our examples from this website.

  .. rst-class:: mt-3
- |desktop| |ensp| With **System Info**, list the versions of all installed MNE-Python-related packages.

  .. rst-class:: mt-3
- |terminal| |ensp| The **Prompt** drops you into a command line interface with a properly activated MNE-Python environment.


.. note::
   |hourglass| |ensp| Depending on your system, it may take a little while for these
   applications to start, especially on the very first run â€“ which may take
   particularly long on Apple Silicon-based computers. Subsequent runs should
   usually be much faster.


VS Code Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to use MNE-Python with `Visual Studio Code`_, you need to tell the
VS Code Python extension where to find the respective Python executable. To do
so, simply start the **Prompt**. It will display several lines of
information, including a line that will read something like:

.. code-block::

   Using Python: /some/directory/mne-python_1.0.0_1/bin/python

This path is what you need to enter in VS Code when selecting the Python
interpreter.

.. note::
   This information is currently not displayed on the Windows platform.


.. raw:: html

    <script type="text/javascript">
      var platform = "linux";
      if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Win") !== -1) {
        platform = "windows";
      }
      if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Mac") !== -1) {
        // there's no good way to distinguish intel vs M1 in javascript so we
        // just default to showing the first of the 2 macOS tabs
        platform = "macos-intel";
      }
     $(document).ready(function(){
         let all_tab_nodes = document.querySelectorAll(
             '.platform-selector-tabset')[0].children;
         let input_nodes = [...all_tab_nodes].filter(
             child => child.nodeName === "INPUT");
         let tab_label_nodes = [...document.querySelectorAll('.sd-tab-label')];
         let correct_label = tab_label_nodes.filter(
             // label.id is drawn from :name: property in the rST, which must
             // be unique across the whole site (*sigh*)
             label => label.id.startsWith(platform))[0];
         let input_id = correct_label.getAttribute('for');
         let correct_input = input_nodes.filter(node => node.id === input_id)[0];
         correct_input.checked = true;
     });
     </script>
