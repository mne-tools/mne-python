Supported channel types
=======================

.. NOTE: part of this file is included in doc/overview/implementation.rst.
   Changes here are reflected there. If you want to link to this content, link
   to :ref:`channel-types` to link to that section of the implementation.rst
   page. The next line is a target for :start-after: so we can omit the title
   from the include:
   channel-types-begin-content

Channel types are represented in MNE-Python with shortened or abbreviated
names. This page lists all supported channel types, their abbreviated names,
and the measurement unit used to represent data of that type. Where channel
types occur in two or more sub-types, the sub-type abbreviations are given in
parentheses. More information about measurement units is given in the
:ref:`units` section.

.. NOTE: To include only the table, here's a different target for :start-after:
