==========================================================
Frequency-tagging: Basic analysis of an SSVEP/vSSR dataset
==========================================================

In this tutorial we compute the frequency spectrum and quantify signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at a target frequency in EEG data recorded during fast periodic
visual stimulation (FPVS) at 12 Hz and 15 Hz in different trials.
Extracting SNR at stimulation frequency is a simple way to quantify frequency
tagged responses in MEEG (a.k.a. steady state visually evoked potentials,
SSVEP, or visual steady-state responses, vSSR in the visual domain,
or auditory steady-state responses, ASSR in the auditory domain).

For a general introduction to the method see
`Norcia et al. (2015) <https://doi.org/10.1167/15.6.4>`_ for the visual domain,
and `Picton et al. (2003) <https://doi.org/10.3109/14992020309101316>`_ for
the auditory domain.

**Data and outline:**

We use a simple example dataset with frequency tagged visual stimulation:
N=2 participants observed checkerboard patterns inverting with a constant
frequency of either 12.0 Hz of 15.0 Hz.
32 channels wet EEG was recorded.
(see :ref:`ssvep-dataset` for more information).

We will visualize both the power-spectral density (PSD) and the SNR
spectrum of the epoched data,
extract SNR at stimulation frequency,
plot the topography of the response,
and statistically separate 12 Hz and 15 Hz responses in the different trials.
Since the evoked response is mainly generated in early visual areas of the
brain the statistical analysis will be carried out on an occipital
ROI.

# * Raw data have FCz reference, so we will apply common-average rereferencing.
#
# * We  will apply a 0.1 highpass filter.
#

# Frequency analysis
# ------------------
# Now we compute the frequency spectrum of the EEG data.
# You will already see the peaks at the stimulation frequencies and some of
# their harmonics, without any further processing.
#
# The 'classical' PSD plot will be compared to a plot of the SNR spectrum.
# SNR will be computed as a ratio of the power in a given frequency bin
# to the average power in its neighboring bins.
# This procedure has two advantages over using the raw PSD:
#
# * it normalizes the spectrum and accounts for 1/f power decay.
#
# * power modulations which are not very narrow band will disappear.
#
# Calculate power spectral density (PSD)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# The frequency spectrum will be computed using Fast Fourier transform (FFT).
# This seems to be common practice in the steady-state literature and is
# based on the exact knowledge of the stimulus and the assumed response -
# especially in terms of it's stability over time.
# For a discussion see e.g.
# `Bach & Meigen (1999) <https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1002648202420>`_
#
# We will exclude the first second of each trial from the analysis:
#
# * steady-state response often take a while to stabilize, and the
#   transient phase in the beginning can distort the signal estimate.
#
# * this section of data is expected to be dominated by responses related to
#   the stimulus onset, and we are not interested in this.
#
# In MNE we call plain FFT as a special case of Welch's method, with only a
# single Welch window spanning the entire trial and no specific windowing
# function (i.e. applying a boxcar window).

# Calculate signal to noise ratio (SNR)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# SNR - as we define it here - is a measure of relative power:
# it's the ratio of power in a given frequency bin - the 'signal' -
# to a 'noise' baseline - the average power in the surrounding frequency bins.
# This approach was initially proposed by
# `Meigen & Bach (1999) <https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1002097208337>`_
#
# Hence, we need to set some parameters for this baseline - how many
# neighboring bins should be taken for this computation, and do we want to skip
# the direct neighbors (this can make sense if the stimulation frequency is not
# super constant, or frequency bands are very narrow).
#
# The function below does what we want.

# You can see that the peaks at the stimulation frequencies (12 Hz, 15 Hz)
# and their harmonics are visible in both plots (just as the line noise at
# 50 Hz).
# Yet, the SNR spectrum shows them more prominently as peaks from a
# noisy but more or less constant baseline of SNR = 1.
# You can further see that the SNR processing removes any broad-band power
# differences (such as the increased power in alpha band around 10 Hz),
# and also removes the 1/f decay in the PSD.
#
# Note, that while the SNR plot implies the possibility of values below 0
# (mean minus sd) such values do not make sense.
# Each SNR value is a ratio of positive PSD values, and the lowest possible PSD
# value is 0 (negative Y-axis values in the upper panel only result from
# plotting PSD on a log scale).
# Hence SNR values must be positive and can minimally go towards 0.

# As described in the intro, we have decided *a priori* to work with average

# - because we expect SNR to be higher on these channels than in other
# channels.
#
# Let's check out, whether this was a good decision!
#
# Here we will plot average SNR for each channel location as a topoplot.
# Then we will do a simple paired T-test to check, whether average SNRs over
# the two sets of channels are significantly different.

# We can see, that 1) this participant indeed exhibits a cluster of channels
# with high SNR in the occipital region and 2) that the average SNR over all
# channels is smaller than the average of the visual ROI computed above.
# The difference is statistically significant. Great!
#
# Such a topography plot can be a nice tool to explore and play with your data
# - e.g. you could try how changing the reference will affect the spatial
# distribution of SNR values.
#
# However, we also wanted to show this plot to point at a potential
# problem with frequency-tagged (or any other brain imaging) data:
# there are many channels and somewhere you will likely find some
# statistically significant effect.
# It is very easy - even unintended - to end up double-dipping or p-hacking.
# So if you want to work with an ROI or individual channels, ideally select
# them *a priori* - before collecting or looking at the data - and preregister
# this decision so people will believe you.
# If you end up selecting an ROI or individual channel for reporting *because
# this channel or ROI shows an effect*, e.g. in an explorative analysis, this
# is also fine but make it transparently and correct for multiple comparison.
#
# Statistical separation of 12 Hz and 15 Hz vSSR
# ----------------------------------------------
# After this little detour into open science, let's move on and
# do the analyses we actually wanted to do:
#
# We will show that we can easily detect and discriminate the brains responses
# in the trials with different stimulation frequencies.
#
# In the frequency and SNR spectrum plot above, we had all trials mixed up.
# Now we will extract 12 and 15 Hz SNR in both types of trials individually,
# and compare the values with a simple t-test.
# We will also extract SNR of the 1st and 2nd harmonic for both stimulation
# frequencies. These are often reported as well and can show interesting

# Debriefing
# ----------
# So that's it, we hope you enjoyed our little tour through this example
# dataset.
#
# As you could see, frequency-tagging is a very powerful tool that can yield
# very high signal to noise ratios and effect sizes that enable you to detect
# brain responses even within a single participant and single trials of only
# a few seconds duration.
#
# Bonus exercises
# ---------------
# For the overly motivated amongst you, let's see what else we can show with
# these data.
#
# Using the PSD function as implemented in MNE makes it very easy to change
# the amount of data that is actually used in the spectrum
# estimation.

# You can see that the signal estimate / our SNR measure increases with the
# trial duration.
#
# This should be easy to understand: in longer recordings there is simply
# more signal (one second of additional stimulation adds, in our case, 12
# cycles of signal) while the noise is (hopefully) stochastic and not locked
# to the stimulation frequency.
# In other words: with more data the signal term grows faster than the noise
# term.
#
# We can further see that the very short trials with FFT windows < 2-3s are not
# great - here we've either hit the noise floor and/or the transient response
# at the trial onset covers too much of the trial.
#
# Again, this tutorial doesn't statistically test for the presence of a neural
# response, but an F-test or Hotelling TÂ² would be appropriate for this
# purpose.
#
# Time resolved SNR
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# ..and finally we can trick MNE's PSD implementation to make it a
# sliding window analysis and come up with a time resolved SNR measure.
# This will reveal whether a participant blinked or scratched their head..
#
# Each of the ten trials is coded with a different color in the plot below.

# Well.. turns out this was a bit too optimistic ;)

# But seriously: this was a nice idea, but we've reached the limit of
# what's possible with this single-subject example dataset.
# However, there might be data, applications, or research questions
