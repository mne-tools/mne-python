======================
MNE with CPP
======================

MNE-CPP is a cross-platform application and algorithm C++ framework 
for MEG/EEG data acquisition, analysis and visualization. It 
provides a modular structure with sub-libraries. The MNE-CPP API 
can be integrated into other stand-alone projects to, e.g. provide 
full I/O support for the FIF-file format or files generated by the 
MNE and Freesurfer suite. MNE-CPPâ€™s 3D visualization library is based 
on the Qt3D module, which provides tools for online data displaying 
with OpenGL. 

MNE-CPP ships with built-in stand-alone applications, some of which 
are closely connected to well-known MNE-C applications. MNE Browse can 
be used to inspect and process pre-recorded data. Among others, dipole 
fitting and the computation of forward solutions have been ported from 
the MNE-C library, including the same command line interfaces. With MNE 
Scan the MNE-CPP project provides an application for acquiring and 
processing MEG/EEG data in real-time. Supported MEG devices include 
the Elekta Neuromag VectorView and BabyMEG system. Several EEG amplifiers 
(TMSI Refa, BrainAmp, ANT eegosports, gUSBamp) are supported as well.
