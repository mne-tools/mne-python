How to cite MNE-Python
======================

Citing the software
-------------------

To cite specific version numbers of the software, you can use the DOIs provided
by `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.592483>`_. Additionally, we ask that
when citing the MNE-Python package, you cite the canonical journal article
reference :footcite:`GramfortEtAl2013a`:

.. footbibliography::

.. collapse:: |quote-left| BibTeX for MNE-Python
    :class: info

    .. include:: ../references.bib
        :code: bibtex
        :start-after: % MNE-Python reference
        :end-before: % everything else


Citing the inverse imaging algorithms
-------------------------------------

To cite MNE-C or the inverse imaging implementations provided by the MNE
software, please use :footcite:`GramfortEtAl2014`:

.. footbibliography::


.. collapse:: |quote-left| BibTeX for inverse algorithms / MNE-C
    :class: info

    .. include:: ../references.bib
        :code: bibtex
        :start-after: % MNE-C reference
        :end-before: % MNE-Python reference


Citing other algorithms
-----------------------

Depending on your research topic, it may also be appropriate to cite related
method papers, some of which are listed in the documentation strings of the
relevant functions or methods. All references cited in the MNE-Python codebase
and documentation are collected in the :ref:`general_bibliography`.
