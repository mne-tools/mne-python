    """Apply a custom EEG referencing scheme.

    Calculates a reference signal by taking the mean of a set of channels and
    applies the reference to another set of channels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : instance of Raw
        Instance of Raw with EEG channels and reference channel(s).
    ref_from : list of str
        The names of the channels to use to construct the reference. If an
        empty list is specified, the data is assumed to already have a proper
        reference and MNE will not attempt any re-referencing of the data.
    ref_to : list of str | None
        The names of the channels to apply the reference to. By default,
        all EEG channels are chosen.
    copy : bool
        Specifies whether instance of Raw will be copied or modified in place.

    Returns
    -------
    raw : instance of Raw
        Instance of Raw with EEG channels rereferenced.
    ref_data : array
        Array of reference data subtracted from EEG channels.

    Notes
    -----
    1. Do not use this function to apply an average reference. By default, an
       average reference projection has already been added upon loading raw
       data.

    2. If the reference is applied to any EEG channels, this function removes
       any pre-existing average reference projections.

    3. During source localization, the EEG signal should have an average
       reference.

    4. The data must be preloaded.

    A bipolar reference takes the difference between two channels (the anode
    minus the cathode) and adds it as a new virtual channel. The original
    channels will be dropped.

    Multiple anodes and cathodes can be specified, in which case multiple
    vitual channels will be created. The 1st anode will be substracted from the
    1st cathode, the 2nd anode from the 2nd cathode, etc.

    By default, the virtual channels will be annotated with channel info of
    the anodes, their locations set to (0, 0, 0) and coil types set to
    EEG_BIPOLAR.

    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : instance of Raw
        Instance of Raw containing the unreferenced channels.
    anode : str | list of str
        The name(s) of the channel(s) to use as anode in the bipolar reference.
    cathode : str | list of str
        The name(s) of the channel(s) to use as cathode in the bipolar
        reference.
    ch_name : str | list of str | None
        The channel name(s) for the virtual channel(s) containing the resulting
        signal. By default, bipolar channels are named after the anode and
        cathode, but it is recommended to supply a more meaningful name.
    ch_info : dict | list of dict | None
        This parameter can be used to supply a dictionary (or a dictionary for
        each bipolar channel) containing channel information to merge in,
        overwriting the default values.
    copy : bool
        Whether to operate on a copy of the raw data (True) or modify it
        in-place (False). Defaults to True.
