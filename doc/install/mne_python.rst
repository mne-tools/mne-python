Installing Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

MNE-Python runs within Python, and depends on several other Python packages.
MNE-Python 0.18 only supports Python version 3.5 or higher. We strongly
recommend the `Anaconda`_ distribution of Python, which comes with more than
250 scientific packages pre-bundled, and includes the ``conda`` command line
tool for installing new packages and managing different package sets
("environments") for different projects. Follow the `installation instructions
for Anaconda`_; when you are done, you should see a similar output if you type
the following command in a terminal:

.. code-block:: console

        $ conda --version && python --version
        conda 4.6.2
        Python 3.6.7 :: Anaconda, Inc.

If you get an error message, consult the Anaconda documentation and search for
Anaconda install tips (`Stack Overflow`_ results are often helpful).

Installing MNE-Python and its dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have Anaconda installed, the easiest way to install
MNE-Python is to use the provided `environment file`_ to install MNE-Python
and its dependencies into a new conda environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mne-tools/mne-python/master/environment.yml
    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate mne

(You can also use a web browser to download the required `environment file`_ if
you do not have ``curl``.) These commands will create a new environment called
``mne`` and then activate it.

Make sure you activate the environment (``conda activate mne``) each time you
open a terminal, or put the activation command in your ``.bashrc`` or
``.profile`` so that it happens automatically.

.. admonition:: |apple| macOS
  :class: note

  If you are on macOS, you need to manually update PyQt5. This step is not
  needed on Linux, and even breaks things on Windows.

  .. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade "pyqt5>=5.10"

Testing MNE-Python installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make sure MNE-Python installed correctly, type the following command in a
terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -c 'import mne; mne.sys_info()'

This should display some system information along with the versions of
MNE-Python and its dependencies. Typical output looks like this:

.. code-block:: console

Troubleshooting MNE-Python installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If something went wrong during installation and you can't figure it out
yourself, check out the :doc:`advanced` page to see if your problem is
discussed there. If not, the `MNE mailing list`_ and `MNE gitter channel`_ are
good resources for troubleshooting installation problems.
