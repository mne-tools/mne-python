    """Artifact Subspace Reconstruction.

    Artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) is an automated, online,
    component-based artifact removal method for removing transient or
    large-amplitude artifacts in multi-channel EEG recordings [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sfreq : float
        Sampling rate of the data, in Hz.
    cutoff: float
        Standard deviation cutoff for rejection. X portions whose variance
        is larger than this threshold relative to the calibration data are
        considered missing data and will be removed. The most aggressive value
        that can be used without losing too much EEG is 2.5. A quite
        conservative value would be 5 (default=5).
    blocksize : int
        Block size for calculating the robust data covariance and thresholds,
        in samples; allows to reduce the memory and time requirements of the
        robust estimators by this factor (down to Channels x Channels x Samples
        x 16 / Blocksize bytes) (default=100).
    win_len : float
        Window length (s) that is used to check the data for artifact content.
        This is ideally as long as the expected time scale of the artifacts but
        not shorter than half a cycle of the high-pass filter that was used
        (default=0.5).
    win_overlap : float
        Window overlap fraction. The fraction of two successive windows that
        overlaps. Higher overlap ensures that fewer artifact portions are going
        to be missed, but is slower (default=0.66).
    max_dropout_fraction : float
        Maximum fraction of windows that can be subject to signal dropouts
        (e.g., sensor unplugged), used for threshold estimation (default=0.1).
    min_clean_fraction : float
        Minimum fraction of windows that need to be clean, used for threshold
        estimation (default=0.25).
    ab : 2-tuple | None
        Coefficients (A, B) of an IIR filter that is used to shape the
        spectrum of the signal when calculating artifact statistics. The
        output signal does not go through this filter. This is an optional way
        to tune the sensitivity of the algorithm to each frequency component
        of the signal. The default filter is less sensitive at alpha and beta
        frequencies and more sensitive at delta (blinks) and gamma (muscle)
        frequencies. Defaults to None.
    max_bad_chans : float
        The maximum number or fraction of bad channels that a retained window
        may still contain (more than this and it is removed). Reasonable range
        is 0.05 (very clean output) to 0.3 (very lax cleaning of only coarse
        artifacts) (default=0.2).
    method : {'riemann', 'euclid'}
        Method to use. If riemann, use the riemannian-modified version of
        ASR [2]_. Currently, only euclidean ASR is supported. Defaults to
        "euclid".

    Attributes
    ----------
    sfreq: array, shape=(n_channels, filter_order)
        Filter initial conditions.
    cutoff: float
        Standard deviation cutoff for rejection.
    blocksize : int
        Block size for calculating the robust data covariance and thresholds.
    win_len : float
        Window length (s) that is used to check the data for artifact content.
    win_overlap : float
        Window overlap fraction.
    max_dropout_fraction : float
        Maximum fraction of windows that can be subject to signal dropouts.
    min_clean_fraction : float
        Minimum fraction of windows.
    max_bad_chans : float
        The maximum fraction of bad channels.
    method : {'riemann', 'euclid'}
        Method to use.
    A, B: arrays
        Coefficients of an IIR filter that is used to shape the spectrum of the
        signal when calculating artifact statistics. The output signal does not
        go through this filter. This is an optional way to tune the sensitivity
        of the algorithm to each frequency component of the signal. The default
        filter is less sensitive at alpha and beta frequencies and more
        sensitive at delta (blinks) and gamma (muscle) frequencies.
    M : array, shape=(channels, channels)
        The mixing matrix to fit ASR data.
    T : array, shape=(channels, channels)
        The mixing matrix to fit ASR data.

        The input to this data is a multi-channel time series of calibration
        data. In typical uses the calibration data is clean resting EEG data
        of data if the fraction of artifact content is below the breakdown
        point of the robust statistics used for estimation (50% theoretical,
        ~30% practical). If the data has a proportion of more than 30-50%
        artifacts then bad time windows should be removed beforehand. This
        data is used to estimate the thresholds that are used by the ASR
        processing function to identify and remove artifact components.

        The calibration data must have been recorded for the same cap design
        from which data for cleanup will be recorded, and ideally should be
        from the same session and same subject, but it is possible to reuse
        the calibration data from a previous session and montage to the
        extent that the cap is placed in the same location (where loss in

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array, shape=(n_channels, n_samples)

        return_clean_window : Bool
            If True, the method will return the variables `clean` (the cropped
             dataset which was used to fit the ASR) and `sample_mask` (a
             logical mask of which samples were included/excluded from fitting

            and no ASR was applied to it.

    """Remove periods with abnormally high-power content from continuous data.

    This function cuts segments from the data which contain high-power
    artifacts. Specifically, only windows are retained which have less than a
    certain fraction of "bad" channels, where a channel is bad in a window if
    its power is above or below a given upper/lower threshold (in standard
    deviations from a robust estimate of the EEG power distribution in the
    channel).

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array, shape=(n_channels, n_samples)
        Continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. >
        1Hz or 0.5Hz - 2.0Hz transition band)
    max_bad_chans : float
        The maximum number or fraction of bad channels that a retained window
        may still contain (more than this and it is removed). Reasonable range
        is 0.05 (very clean output) to 0.3 (very lax cleaning of only coarse
        artifacts) (default=0.2).
    zthresholds : 2-tuple
        The minimum and maximum standard deviations within which the power of
        a channel must lie (relative to a robust estimate of the clean EEG
        power distribution in the channel) for it to be considered "not bad".
        (default=[-3.5, 5]).

    The following are detail parameters that usually do not have to be tuned.
    If you can't get the function to do what you want, you might consider
    adapting these to your data.

    win_len : float
        Window length that is used to check the data for artifact content.
        This is ideally as long as the expected time scale of the artifacts
        but not shorter than half a cycle of the high-pass filter that was
        used. Default: 1.
    win_overlap : float
        Window overlap fraction. The fraction of two successive windows that
        overlaps. Higher overlap ensures that fewer artifact portions are
        going to be missed, but is slower (default=0.66).
    min_clean_fraction : float
        Minimum fraction that needs to be clean. This is the minimum fraction
        of time windows that need to contain essentially uncontaminated EEG.
        (default=0.25)
    max_dropout_fraction : float
        Maximum fraction that can have dropouts. This is the maximum fraction
        of time windows that may have arbitrarily low amplitude (e.g., due to
        the sensors being unplugged) (default=0.1).

    Returns
    -------
    clean : array, shape=(n_channels, n_samples)
        Dataset with bad time periods removed.
    sample_mask : boolean array, shape=(1, n_samples)
        Mask of retained samples (logical array).
