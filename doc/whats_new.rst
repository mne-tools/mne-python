BUG
~~~

    - :func:`compute_raw_psd`, :func:`compute_epochs_psd`, :func:`psd_multitaper`, and :func:`psd_welch` no longer remove rows/columns of the SSP matrix before applying SSP projectors when picks are provided by `Chris Holdgraf`_.

    - :func:`mne.Epochs.plot_psd` no longer calls a Welch PSD, and instead uses a Multitaper method which is more appropriate for epochs. Flags for this function are passed to :func:`mne.time_frequency.psd_multitaper` by `Chris Holdgraf`_

    - Time-cropping functions (e.g., :func:`mne.Epochs.crop`, :func:`mne.Evoked.crop`, :func:`mne.io.Raw.crop`, :func:`mne.SourceEstimate.crop`) made consistent with behavior of ``tmin`` and ``tmax`` of :class:`mne.Epochs`, where nearest sample is kept. For example, for MGH data acquired with ``sfreq=600.614990234``, constructing ``Epochs(..., tmin=-1, tmax=1)`` has bounds ``+/-1.00064103``, and now ``epochs.crop(-1, 1)`` will also have these bounds (previously they would have been ``+/-0.99897607``). This also has minor effects on functions that use cropping under the hood, such as :func:`mne.compute_covariance` and :func:`mne.connectivity.spectral_connectivity`.

    - Fix EEG spherical spline interpolation code to account for average reference by `Mainak Jas`_ (`#2758 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/2758>`_)

    - Fix :func:`mne.decoding.TimeDecoding` to allow specifying ``clf`` by `Jean-Remi King`_

    - Fix bug with units (uV) in 'Brain Vision Data Exchange Header File Version 1.0' by `Federico Raimondo`_

    - Fix bug where :func:`mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter` ``destination`` parameter did not properly set device-to-head transform by `Eric Larson`_

    - Fix bug in rank calculation of :func:`mne.utils.estimate_rank`, :func:`mne.io.Raw.estimate_rank`, and covariance functions where the tolerance was set to slightly too small a value, new 'auto' mode uses values from ``scipy.linalg.orth`` by `Eric Larson`_.

    - Fix bug when specifying irregular ``train_times['slices']`` in :func:`mne.decoding.GeneralizationAcrossTime`, by `Jean-Remi King`_

    - Fix colorbar range on norm data by `Jaakko Leppakangas`_

    - Fix bug in :func:`mne.preprocessing.run_ica`, which used the ``ecg_criterion`` parameter for the EOG criterion instead of ``eog_criterion`` by `Christian Brodbeck`_

    - Fix normals in CTF data reader by `Eric Larson`_

    - Fix bug in :func:`mne.io.read_raw_ctf`, when omitting samples at the end by `Jaakko Leppakangas`_

    - Remove measurement date from :class:`mne.io.Info` in :func:`mne.io.Raw.anonymize` by `Eric Larson`_

    - Fix bug that caused synthetic ecg channel creation even if channel was specified for ECG peak detection in :func:`mne.preprocessing.create_ecg_epochs` by `Jaakko Leppakangas`_

    - Fix bug with vmin and vmax when None is passed in :func:`mne.viz.plot_topo_image_epochs` by `Jaakko Leppakangas`_

    - Fix bug with :func:`mne.label_sign_flip` (and :func:`mne.extract_label_time_course`) by `Natalie Klein`_ and `Eric Larson`_

    - Add copy parameter in :func:`mne.Epochs.apply_baseline` and :func:`mne.io.Raw.filter` methods by `Jona Sassenhagen`_ and `Alex Gramfort`_

    - Fix bug in :func:`mne.merge_events` when using ``replace_events=False`` by `Alex Gramfort`_

    - Fix bug in :class:`mne.Evoked` type setting in :func:`mne.stats.linear_regression_raw` by `Eric Larson`_

    - Fix bug in :class: `mne.io.edf.RawEDF` highpass filter setting to take max highpass to match warning message by `Teon Brooks`_

    - Fix bugs with coordinane frame adjustments in :func:`mne.viz.plot_trans` by `Eric Larson`_

    - Fix bug in colormap selection in :func:`mne.Evoked.plot_projs_topomap` by `Jaakko Leppakangas`_

    - Fix bug in source normal adjustment that occurred when 1) patch information is available (e.g., when distances have been calculated) and 2) points are excluded from the source space (by inner skull distance) by `Eric Larson`_

API
~~~

    - The default `picks=None` in :func:`mne.viz.plot_epochs_image` now only plots the first 5 channels, not all channels, by `Jona Sassenhagen`_

    - The ``mesh_color`` parameter in :func:`mne.viz.plot_dipole_locations` has been removed (use `brain_color` instead), by `Marijn van Vliet`_

    - Deprecated functions :func:`mne.time_frequency.compute_raw_psd` and :func:`mne.time_frequency.compute_epochs_psd`, replaced by :func:`mne.time_frequency.psd_welch` by `Chris Holdgraf`_

    - Deprecated function :func:`mne.time_frequency.multitaper_psd` and replaced by :func:`mne.time_frequency.psd_multitaper` by `Chris Holdgraf`_

    - The `'ch_names'` and `'nchan'` fields of the :class:`mne.io.Info` class are now read-only and are automatically updated to accommodate changes in the `'chs'` field, by `Marijn van Vliet`_

    - The ``y_pred`` attribute in :func:`mne.decoding.GeneralizationAcrossTime` and :func:`mne.decoding.TimeDecoding` is now a numpy array, by `Jean-Remi King`_

    - The :func:`mne.bem.fit_sphere_to_headshape` function now default to ``dig_kinds='auto'`` which will use extra digitization points, falling back to extra plus eeg digitization points if there not enough extra points are available.

    - The :func:`mne.bem.fit_sphere_to_headshape` now has a ``units`` argument that should be set explicitly. This will default to ``units='mm'`` in 0.12 for backward compatibility but change to ``units='m'`` in 0.13.

    - Added default parameters in Epochs class namely ``event_id=None``, ``tmin=-0.2`` and ``tmax=0.5``.

    - To unify and extend the behavior of :func:`mne.comupute_raw_covariance` relative to :func:`mne.compute_covariance`, the default parameter ``tstep=0.2`` now discards any epochs at the end of the :class:`mne.io.Raw` instance that are not the full ``tstep`` duration. This will slighly change the computation of :func:`mne.compute_raw_covaraince`, but should only potentially have a big impact if the :class:`mne.io.Raw` instance is short relative to ``tstep`` and the last, too short (now discarded) epoch contained data inconsistent with the epochs that preceded it.

    - The default ``picks=None`` in :func:`mne.io.Raw.filter` nows picks eeg, meg and seeg channels, by `Jean-Remi King`_

    - EOG, ECG and EMG channels are now plotted by default (if present in data) when using :func:`mne.viz.plot_evoked` by `Marijn van Vliet`_


    - Replace pseudoinverse-based solver with much faster Cholesky solver in :func:`mne.stats.linear_regression_raw`, by `Jona Sassenhagen`_.

    - CTF data reader now reads EEG locations from .pos file as HPI points by `Jaakko Leppakangas`_

    - Subselecting channels can now emit a warning if many channels have been subselected from projection vectors. We recommend only computing projection vertors for and applying projectors to channels that will be used in the final analysis. However, after picking a subset of channels, projection vectors can be renormalized with :func:`mne.io.Info.normalize_proj` if necessary to avoid warnings about subselection. Changes by `Eric Larson`_ and `Alex Gramfort`_.

   - Deprecate ``mne.fiff`` module, use ``mne.io`` instead e.g. ``mne.io.Raw`` instead of ``mne.fiff.Raw``.

   - Pick functions (e.g., ``pick_types``) are now in the mne namespace (e.g. use ``mne.pick_types``).

   - Deprecated ICA methods specific to one container type. Use ICA.fit, ICA.get_sources ICA.apply and ICA.plot_XXX for processing Raw, Epochs and Evoked objects.

   - The default smoothing method for ``mne.stc_to_label`` will change in v0.9, and the old method is deprecated.

   - As default, for ICA the maximum number of PCA components equals the number of channels passed. The number of PCA components used to reconstruct the sensor space signals now defaults to the maximum number of PCA components estimated.

~~~

   - Deprecated use of fiff.pick_types without specifying exclude -- use either [] (none), ``bads`` (bad channels), or a list of string (channel names).

   - Depth bias correction in dSPM/MNE/sLORETA make_inverse_operator is now done like in the C code using only gradiometers if present, else magnetometers, and EEG if no MEG channels are present.

   - Fixed-orientation inverse solutions need to be made using `fixed=True` option (using non-surface-oriented forward solutions if no depth weighting is used) to maintain compatibility with MNE C code.

   - Raw.save() will only overwrite the destination file, if it exists, if option overwrite=True is set.

   - mne.utils.set_config(), get_config(), get_config_path() moved to mne namespace.

   - Raw constructor argument proj_active deprecated -- use proj argument instead.

   - Functions from the mne.mixed_norm module have been moved to the mne.inverse_sparse module.

   - Deprecate CTF compensation (keep_comp and dest_comp) in Epochs and move it to Raw with a single compensation parameter.

   - Remove artifacts module. Artifacts- and preprocessing related functions can now be found in mne.preprocessing.
