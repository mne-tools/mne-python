BUG
~~~

- Fix incorrect ``times`` attribute when stc was computed using ``apply_inverse`` after decimation at epochs stage for certain, arbitrary sample frequencies by `Denis Engemann`_

- Fix ICA pre-whitening, avoid recomputation when applying ICA to new data by `Denis Engemann`_

API
~~~

- The minimum numpy version has been increased to 1.6 from 1.4.

- Epochs object now has a selection attribute to track provenance of selected Epochs. The length of the drop_log attribute is now the same as the length of the original events passed to Epochs. In earlier versions it had the length of the events filtered by event_id. Epochs has also now a plot_drop_log method.

- Deprecate Epochs.drop_picks in favor of a new method called drop_channels

- Deprecate ``labels_from_parc`` and ``parc_from_labels`` in favor of ``read_labels_from_annot`` and ``write_labels_to_annot``

- The default of the new add_dist option of ``setup_source_space`` to add patch information will change from False to True in MNE-Python 0.9

- Deprecate ``read_evoked`` and ``write_evoked`` in favor of ``read_evokeds`` and ``write_evokeds``. read_evokeds will return all `Evoked` instances in a file by default.

- Deprecate ``setno`` in favor of ``condition`` in the initialization of an Evoked instance. This affects ``mne.fiff.Evoked`` and ``read_evokeds``, but not ``read_evoked``.

- Deprecate ``mne.fiff`` module, use ``mne.io`` instead e.g. ``mne.io.Raw`` instead of ``mne.fiff.Raw``.

- Pick functions (e.g., ``pick_types``) are now in the mne namespace (e.g. use ``mne.pick_types``).

- Deprecated ICA methods specific to one container type. Use ICA.fit, ICA.get_sources ICA.apply and ``ICA.plot_*`` for processing Raw, Epochs and Evoked objects.

- The default smoothing method for ``mne.stc_to_label`` will change in v0.9, and the old method is deprecated.

- As default, for ICA the maximum number of PCA components equals the number of channels passed. The number of PCA components used to reconstruct the sensor space signals now defaults to the maximum number of PCA components estimated.
