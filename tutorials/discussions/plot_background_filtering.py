Background information on filtering
===================================

Here we give some background information on filtering in general, and
how it is done in MNE-Python in particular.
Recommended reading for practical applications of digital
filter design can be found in Parks & Burrus (1987) [1]_ and
Ifeachor & Jervis (2002) [2]_, and for filtering in an
M/EEG context we recommend reading Widmann *et al.* (2015) [7]_.
To see how to use the default filters in MNE-Python on actual data, see
the :ref:`tut-filter-resample` tutorial.

Problem statement
=================

Practical issues with filtering electrophysiological data are covered
in Widmann *et al.* (2012) [6]_, where they conclude with this statement:

    Filtering can result in considerable distortions of the time course
    (and amplitude) of a signal as demonstrated by VanRullen (2011) [[3]_].
    Thus, filtering should not be used lightly. However, if effects of
    filtering are cautiously considered and filter artifacts are minimized,
    a valid interpretation of the temporal dynamics of filtered
    electrophysiological data is possible and signals missed otherwise
    can be detected with filtering.

In other words, filtering can increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but if it
is not used carefully, it can distort data. Here we hope to cover some
filtering basics so users can better understand filtering trade-offs and why
MNE-Python has chosen particular defaults.

.. _tut_filtering_basics:

Filtering basics
================

Let's get some of the basic math down. In the frequency domain, digital
filters have a transfer function that is given by:

.. math::

    H(z) &= \frac{b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \ldots + b_M z^{-M}}
                 {1 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2} + \ldots + a_N z^{-M}} \\
         &= \frac{\sum_{k=0}^Mb_kz^{-k}}{\sum_{k=1}^Na_kz^{-k}}

In the time domain, the numerator coefficients :math:`b_k` and denominator
coefficients :math:`a_k` can be used to obtain our output data
:math:`y(n)` in terms of our input data :math:`x(n)` as:

.. math::
   :label: summations

    y(n) &= b_0 x(n) + b_1 x(n-1) + \ldots + b_M x(n-M)
            - a_1 y(n-1) - a_2 y(n - 2) - \ldots - a_N y(n - N)\\
         &= \sum_{k=0}^M b_k x(n-k) - \sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)

In other words, the output at time :math:`n` is determined by a sum over

    1. the numerator coefficients :math:`b_k`, which get multiplied by
       the previous input values :math:`x(n-k)`, and
    2. the denominator coefficients :math:`a_k`, which get multiplied by
       the previous output values :math:`y(n-k)`.

Note that these summations correspond to (1) a weighted `moving average`_ and
(2) an autoregression_.

Filters are broken into two classes: FIR_ (finite impulse response) and
IIR_ (infinite impulse response) based on these coefficients.
FIR filters use a finite number of numerator
coefficients :math:`b_k` (:math:`\forall k, a_k=0`), and thus each output
value of :math:`y(n)` depends only on the :math:`M` previous input values.
IIR filters depend on the previous input and output values, and thus can have
effectively infinite impulse responses.

As outlined in Parks & Burrus (1987) [1]_, FIR and IIR have different
trade-offs:

    * A causal FIR filter can be linear-phase -- i.e., the same time delay
      across all frequencies -- whereas a causal IIR filter cannot. The phase
      and group delay characteristics are also usually better for FIR filters.
    * IIR filters can generally have a steeper cutoff than an FIR filter of
      equivalent order.
    * IIR filters are generally less numerically stable, in part due to
      accumulating error (due to its recursive calculations).

In MNE-Python we default to using FIR filtering. As noted in Widmann *et al.*
(2015) [7]_:

    Despite IIR filters often being considered as computationally more
    efficient, they are recommended only when high throughput and sharp
    cutoffs are required (Ifeachor and Jervis, 2002 [[2]_], p. 321)...
    FIR filters are easier to control, are always stable, have a
    well-defined passband, can be corrected to zero-phase without
    additional computations, and can be converted to minimum-phase.
    We therefore recommend FIR filters for most purposes in
    electrophysiological data analysis.

When designing a filter (FIR or IIR), there are always trade-offs that
need to be considered, including but not limited to:

    1. Ripple in the pass-band
    2. Attenuation of the stop-band
    3. Steepness of roll-off
    4. Filter order (i.e., length for FIR filters)
    5. Time-domain ringing

In general, the sharper something is in frequency, the broader it is in time,
and vice-versa. This is a fundamental time-frequency trade-off, and it will
show up below.

FIR Filters
===========

First, we will focus on FIR filters, which are the default filters used by
MNE-Python.

# Designing FIR filters
# ---------------------
# Here we'll try to design a low-pass filter and look at trade-offs in terms
# of time- and frequency-domain filter characteristics. Later, in
# :ref:`tut_effect_on_signals`, we'll look at how such filters can affect
# signals when they are used.
#
# First let's import some useful tools for filtering, and set some default
# values for our data that are reasonable for M/EEG.

import numpy as np
from numpy.fft import fft, fftfreq
from scipy import signal
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from mne.time_frequency.tfr import morlet
from mne.viz import plot_filter, plot_ideal_filter

import mne

sfreq = 1000.
f_p = 40.
flim = (1., sfreq / 2.)  # limits for plotting

###############################################################################
# Take for example an ideal low-pass filter, which would give a magnitude
# response of 1 in the pass-band (up to frequency :math:`f_p`) and a magnitude
# response of 0 in the stop-band (down to frequency :math:`f_s`) such that
# :math:`f_p=f_s=40` Hz here (shown to a lower limit of -60 dB for simplicity):

nyq = sfreq / 2.  # the Nyquist frequency is half our sample rate
freq = [0, f_p, f_p, nyq]
gain = [1, 1, 0, 0]

third_height = np.array(plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']) * [1, 1. / 3.]
ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=third_height)[1]
plot_ideal_filter(freq, gain, ax, title='Ideal %s Hz lowpass' % f_p, flim=flim)

###############################################################################
# This filter hypothetically achieves zero ripple in the frequency domain,
# perfect attenuation, and perfect steepness. However, due to the discontinuity
# in the frequency response, the filter would require infinite ringing in the
# time domain (i.e., infinite order) to be realized. Another way to think of
# this is that a rectangular window in the frequency domain is actually a sinc_
# function in the time domain, which requires an infinite number of samples
# (and thus infinite time) to represent. So although this filter has ideal
# frequency suppression, it has poor time-domain characteristics.
#
# Let's try to naïvely make a brick-wall filter of length 0.1 s, and look
# at the filter itself in the time domain and the frequency domain:

n = int(round(0.1 * sfreq))
n -= n % 2 - 1  # make it odd
t = np.arange(-(n // 2), n // 2 + 1) / sfreq  # center our sinc
h = np.sinc(2 * f_p * t) / (4 * np.pi)
plot_filter(h, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Sinc (0.1 s)', flim=flim, compensate=True)

###############################################################################
# This is not so good! Making the filter 10 times longer (1 s) gets us a
# slightly better stop-band suppression, but still has a lot of ringing in
# the time domain. Note the x-axis is an order of magnitude longer here,
# and the filter has a correspondingly much longer group delay (again equal
# to half the filter length, or 0.5 seconds):

n = int(round(1. * sfreq))
n -= n % 2 - 1  # make it odd
t = np.arange(-(n // 2), n // 2 + 1) / sfreq
h = np.sinc(2 * f_p * t) / (4 * np.pi)
plot_filter(h, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Sinc (1.0 s)', flim=flim, compensate=True)

###############################################################################
# Let's make the stop-band tighter still with a longer filter (10 s),
# with a resulting larger x-axis:

n = int(round(10. * sfreq))
n -= n % 2 - 1  # make it odd
t = np.arange(-(n // 2), n // 2 + 1) / sfreq
h = np.sinc(2 * f_p * t) / (4 * np.pi)
plot_filter(h, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Sinc (10.0 s)', flim=flim, compensate=True)

###############################################################################
# Now we have very sharp frequency suppression, but our filter rings for the
# entire 10 seconds. So this naïve method is probably not a good way to build
# our low-pass filter.
#
# Fortunately, there are multiple established methods to design FIR filters
# based on desired response characteristics. These include:
#
#     1. The Remez_ algorithm (:func:`scipy.signal.remez`, `MATLAB firpm`_)
#     2. Windowed FIR design (:func:`scipy.signal.firwin2`,
#        :func:`scipy.signal.firwin`, and `MATLAB fir2`_)
#     3. Least squares designs (:func:`scipy.signal.firls`, `MATLAB firls`_)
#     4. Frequency-domain design (construct filter in Fourier
#        domain and use an :func:`IFFT <numpy.fft.ifft>` to invert it)
#
# .. note:: Remez and least squares designs have advantages when there are
#           "do not care" regions in our frequency response. However, we want
#           well controlled responses in all frequency regions.
#           Frequency-domain construction is good when an arbitrary response
#           is desired, but generally less clean (due to sampling issues) than
#           a windowed approach for more straightforward filter applications.
#           Since our filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop)
#           are fairly simple and we require precise control of all frequency
#           regions, we will primarily use and explore windowed FIR design.
#
# If we relax our frequency-domain filter requirements a little bit, we can
# use these functions to construct a lowpass filter that instead has a
# *transition band*, or a region between the pass frequency :math:`f_p`
# and stop frequency :math:`f_s`, e.g.:

trans_bandwidth = 10  # 10 Hz transition band
f_s = f_p + trans_bandwidth  # = 50 Hz

freq = [0., f_p, f_s, nyq]
gain = [1., 1., 0., 0.]
ax = plt.subplots(1, figsize=third_height)[1]
title = '%s Hz lowpass with a %s Hz transition' % (f_p, trans_bandwidth)
plot_ideal_filter(freq, gain, ax, title=title, flim=flim)

###############################################################################
# Accepting a shallower roll-off of the filter in the frequency domain makes
# our time-domain response potentially much better. We end up with a more
# gradual slope through the transition region, but a *much* cleaner time
# domain signal. Here again for the 1 s filter:

h = signal.firwin2(n, freq, gain, nyq=nyq)
plot_filter(h, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Windowed 10 Hz transition (1.0 s)',
            flim=flim, compensate=True)

###############################################################################
# Since our lowpass is around 40 Hz with a 10 Hz transition, we can actually
# use a shorter filter (5 cycles at 10 Hz = 0.5 s) and still get acceptable
# stop-band attenuation:

n = int(round(sfreq * 0.5)) + 1
h = signal.firwin2(n, freq, gain, nyq=nyq)
plot_filter(h, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Windowed 10 Hz transition (0.5 s)',
            flim=flim, compensate=True)

###############################################################################
# But if we shorten the filter too much (2 cycles of 10 Hz = 0.2 s),
# our effective stop frequency gets pushed out past 60 Hz:

n = int(round(sfreq * 0.2)) + 1
h = signal.firwin2(n, freq, gain, nyq=nyq)
plot_filter(h, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Windowed 10 Hz transition (0.2 s)',
            flim=flim, compensate=True)

###############################################################################
# If we want a filter that is only 0.1 seconds long, we should probably use
# something more like a 25 Hz transition band (0.2 s = 5 cycles @ 25 Hz):

trans_bandwidth = 25
f_s = f_p + trans_bandwidth
freq = [0, f_p, f_s, nyq]
h = signal.firwin2(n, freq, gain, nyq=nyq)
plot_filter(h, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Windowed 50 Hz transition (0.2 s)',
            flim=flim, compensate=True)

###############################################################################
# So far, we have only discussed *non-causal* filtering, which means that each
# sample at each time point :math:`t` is filtered using samples that come
# after (:math:`t + \Delta t`) *and* before (:math:`t - \Delta t`) the current
# time point :math:`t`.
# In this sense, each sample is influenced by samples that come both before
# and after it. This is useful in many cases, especially because it does not
# delay the timing of events.
#
# However, sometimes it can be beneficial to use *causal* filtering,
# whereby each sample :math:`t` is filtered only using time points that came
# after it.
#
# Note that the delay is variable (whereas for linear/zero-phase filters it
# is constant) but small in the pass-band. Unlike zero-phase filters, which
# require time-shifting backward the output of a linear-phase filtering stage
# (and thus becoming non-causal), minimum-phase filters do not require any
# compensation to achieve small delays in the pass-band. Note that as an
# artifact of the minimum phase filter construction step, the filter does
# not end up being as steep as the linear/zero-phase version.
#
# We can construct a minimum-phase filter from our existing linear-phase
# filter with the :func:`scipy.signal.minimum_phase` function, and note
# that the falloff is not as steep:

h_min = signal.minimum_phase(h)
plot_filter(h_min, sfreq, freq, gain, 'Minimum-phase', flim=flim)

# them to some data.

# IIR filters
# ===========
#
# MNE-Python also offers IIR filtering functionality that is based on the
# methods from :mod:`scipy.signal`. Specifically, we use the general-purpose
# functions :func:`scipy.signal.iirfilter` and :func:`scipy.signal.iirdesign`,
# which provide unified interfaces to IIR filter design.
#
# Designing IIR filters
# ---------------------
#
# Let's continue with our design of a 40 Hz low-pass filter and look at
# some trade-offs of different IIR filters.
#
# Often the default IIR filter is a `Butterworth filter`_, which is designed
# to have a *maximally flat pass-band*. Let's look at a few filter orders,
# i.e., a few different number of coefficients used and therefore steepness
# of the filter:
#
# .. note:: Notice that the group delay (which is related to the phase) of
#           the IIR filters below are not constant. In the FIR case, we can
#           design so-called linear-phase filters that have a constant group
#           delay, and thus compensate for the delay (making the filter
#           non-causal) if necessary. This cannot be done with IIR filters, as
#           they have a non-linear phase (non-constant group delay). As the
#           filter order increases, the phase distortion near and in the
#           transition band worsens. However, if non-causal (forward-backward)
#           filtering can be used, e.g. with :func:`scipy.signal.filtfilt`,
#           these phase issues can theoretically be mitigated.

sos = signal.iirfilter(2, f_p / nyq, btype='low', ftype='butter', output='sos')
plot_filter(dict(sos=sos), sfreq, freq, gain, 'Butterworth order=2', flim=flim,
            compensate=True)
x_shallow = signal.sosfiltfilt(sos, x)
del sos

###############################################################################
# The falloff of this filter is not very steep.
#
# .. note:: Here we have made use of second-order sections (SOS)
#           by using :func:`scipy.signal.sosfilt` and, under the
#           hood, :func:`scipy.signal.zpk2sos` when passing the
#           ``output='sos'`` keyword argument to
#           :func:`scipy.signal.iirfilter`. The filter definitions
#           given :ref:`above <tut_filtering_basics>` use the polynomial
#           numerator/denominator (sometimes called "tf") form ``(b, a)``,
#           which are theoretically equivalent to the SOS form used here.
#           In practice, however, the SOS form can give much better results
#           due to issues with numerical precision (see
#           :func:`scipy.signal.sosfilt` for an example), so SOS should be
#           used whenever possible.
#
# Let's increase the order, and note that now we have better attenuation,

# There are other types of IIR filters that we can use. For a complete list,
# check out the documentation for :func:`scipy.signal.iirdesign`. Let's
# try a Chebychev (type I) filter, which trades off ripple in the pass-band
# to get better attenuation in the stop-band:

iir_params.update(ftype='cheby1',

# Some pitfalls of filtering
# ==========================
#
# Multiple recent papers have noted potential risks of drawing
# errant inferences due to misapplication of filters.
#
# Low-pass problems
# -----------------
#
# Filters in general, especially those that are non-causal (zero-phase), can
# make activity appear to occur earlier or later than it truly did. As
# mentioned in VanRullen (2011) [3]_, investigations of commonly (at the time)
# used low-pass filters created artifacts when they were applied to simulated
# data. However, such deleterious effects were minimal in many real-world
# examples in Rousselet (2012) [5]_.
#
# Perhaps more revealing, it was noted in Widmann & Schröger (2012) [6]_ that
# the problematic low-pass filters from VanRullen (2011) [3]_:
#
#    1. Used a least-squares design (like :func:`scipy.signal.firls`) that
#       included "do-not-care" transition regions, which can lead to
#       uncontrolled behavior.
#    2. Had a filter length that was independent of the transition bandwidth,
#       which can cause excessive ringing and signal distortion.
#
# .. _tut_filtering_hp_problems:
#
# High-pass problems
# ------------------
#
# When it comes to high-pass filtering, using corner frequencies above 0.1 Hz
# were found in Acunzo *et al.* (2012) [4]_ to:
#
#    "... generate a systematic bias easily leading to misinterpretations of
#    neural activity.”
#
# In a related paper, Widmann *et al.* (2015) [7]_ also came to suggest a
# 0.1 Hz highpass. More evidence followed in Tanner *et al.* (2015) [8]_ of
# such distortions. Using data from language ERP studies of semantic and
# syntactic processing (i.e., N400 and P600), using a high-pass above 0.3 Hz
# caused significant effects to be introduced implausibly early when compared
# to the unfiltered data. From this, the authors suggested the optimal
# high-pass value for language processing to be 0.1 Hz.
#
# We can recreate a problematic simulation from Tanner *et al.* (2015) [8]_:
#
#    "The simulated component is a single-cycle cosine wave with an amplitude
#    of 5µV [sic], onset of 500 ms poststimulus, and duration of 800 ms. The
#    simulated component was embedded in 20 s of zero values to avoid
#    filtering edge effects... Distortions [were] caused by 2 Hz low-pass
#    and high-pass filters... No visible distortion to the original
#    waveform [occurred] with 30 Hz low-pass and 0.01 Hz high-pass filters...
#    Filter frequencies correspond to the half-amplitude (-6 dB) cutoff
#    (12 dB/octave roll-off)."
#
# .. note:: This simulated signal contains energy not just within the
#           pass-band, but also within the transition and stop-bands -- perhaps
#           most easily understood because the signal has a non-zero DC value,
#           but also because it is a shifted cosine that has been
#           *windowed* (here multiplied by a rectangular window), which
#           makes the cosine and DC frequencies spread to other frequencies
#           (multiplication in time is convolution in frequency, so multiplying
#           by a rectangular window in the time domain means convolving a sinc
#           function with the impulses at DC and the cosine frequency in the
#           frequency domain).

# Similarly, in a P300 paradigm reported by Kappenman & Luck (2010) [12]_,
# they found that applying a 1 Hz high-pass decreased the probability of
# finding a significant difference in the N100 response, likely because
# the P300 response was smeared (and inverted) in time by the high-pass
# filter such that it tended to cancel out the increased N100. However,
# they nonetheless note that some high-passing can still be useful to deal
# with drifts in the data.
#
# Even though these papers generally advise a 0.1 Hz or lower frequency for
# a high-pass, it is important to keep in mind (as most authors note) that
# filtering choices should depend on the frequency content of both the
# signal(s) of interest and the noise to be suppressed. For example, in
# some of the MNE-Python examples involving :ref:`sample-data`,
# high-pass values of around 1 Hz are used when looking at auditory
# or visual N100 responses, because we analyze standard (not deviant) trials
# and thus expect that contamination by later or slower components will
# be limited.
#
# Baseline problems (or solutions?)
# ---------------------------------
#
# In an evolving discussion, Tanner *et al.* (2015) [8]_ suggest using baseline

# not offer substantial advantages over standard high-pass filtering.
# Tanner *et al.* (2016) [10]_ rebutted that baseline correction can correct

# In response, Maess *et al.* (2016) [11]_ note that these simulations do not
# address cases of pre-stimulus activity that is shared across conditions, as
# applying baseline correction will effectively copy the topology outside the
# baseline period. We can see this if we give our signal ``x`` with some
# consistent pre-stimulus activity, which makes everything look bad.
#
# .. note:: An important thing to keep in mind with these plots is that they
#           are for a single simulated sensor. In multi-electrode recordings
#           the topology (i.e., spatial pattern) of the pre-stimulus activity
#           will leak into the post-stimulus period. This will likely create a
#           spatially varying distortion of the time-domain signals, as the
#           averaged pre-stimulus spatial pattern gets subtracted from the
#           sensor time courses.
#
# Putting some activity in the baseline period:

n_pre = (t < 0).sum()

# Both groups seem to acknowledge that the choices of filtering cutoffs, and

#
#    1. The frequency content of the underlying evoked activity relative
#       to the filtering parameters.
#    2. The validity of the assumption of no consistent evoked activity
#       in the baseline period.
#
# We thus recommend carefully applying baseline correction and/or high-pass
# values based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed.
#
#
# Filtering defaults
# ==================
#
# .. _tut_filtering_in_python:
#
# Defaults in MNE-Python
# ----------------------
#
# Most often, filtering in MNE-Python is done at the :class:`mne.io.Raw` level,
# and thus :func:`mne.io.Raw.filter` is used. This function under the hood
# (among other things) calls :func:`mne.filter.filter_data` to actually
# filter the data, which by default applies a zero-phase FIR filter designed
# using :func:`scipy.signal.firwin`. In Widmann *et al.* (2015) [7]_, they
# suggest a specific set of parameters to use for high-pass filtering,
# including:
#
#     "... providing a transition bandwidth of 25% of the lower passband
#     edge but, where possible, not lower than 2 Hz and otherwise the
#     distance from the passband edge to the critical frequency.”
#
# In practice, this means that for each high-pass value ``l_freq`` or
# low-pass value ``h_freq`` below, you would get this corresponding
# ``l_trans_bandwidth`` or ``h_trans_bandwidth``, respectively,
# if the sample rate were 100 Hz (i.e., Nyquist frequency of 50 Hz):
#
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# | l_freq or h_freq | l_trans_bandwidth | h_trans_bandwidth |
# +==================+===================+===================+
# |             0.01 |              0.01 |               2.0 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |              0.1 |               0.1 |               2.0 |

# |              1.0 |               1.0 |               2.0 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |              2.0 |               2.0 |               2.0 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |              4.0 |               2.0 |               2.0 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |              8.0 |               2.0 |               2.0 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |             10.0 |               2.5 |               2.5 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |             20.0 |               5.0 |               5.0 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |             40.0 |              10.0 |              10.0 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
# |             50.0 |              12.5 |              12.5 |
# +------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
#
# MNE-Python has adopted this definition for its high-pass (and low-pass)
# transition bandwidth choices when using ``l_trans_bandwidth='auto'`` and
# ``h_trans_bandwidth='auto'``.
#
# To choose the filter length automatically with ``filter_length='auto'``,
# the reciprocal of the shortest transition bandwidth is used to ensure
# decent attenuation at the stop frequency. Specifically, the reciprocal
# (in samples) is multiplied by 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0 for the Hann, Hamming,
# or Blackman windows, respectively, as selected by the ``fir_window``
# argument for ``fir_design='firwin'``, and double these for
# ``fir_design='firwin2'`` mode.
#
# .. note:: For ``fir_design='firwin2'``, the multiplicative factors are
#           doubled compared to what is given in Ifeachor & Jervis (2002) [2]_
#           (p. 357), as :func:`scipy.signal.firwin2` has a smearing effect
#           on the frequency response, which we compensate for by
#           increasing the filter length. This is why
#           ``fir_desgin='firwin'`` is preferred to ``fir_design='firwin2'``.
#
# In 0.14, we default to using a Hamming window in filter design, as it
# provides up to 53 dB of stop-band attenuation with small pass-band ripple.
#
# .. note:: In band-pass applications, often a low-pass filter can operate
#           effectively with fewer samples than the high-pass filter, so
#           it is advisable to apply the high-pass and low-pass separately
#           when using ``fir_design='firwin2'``. For design mode
#           ``fir_design='firwin'``, there is no need to separate the
#           operations, as the lowpass and highpass elements are constructed
#           separately to meet the transition band requirements.
#
# For more information on how to use the
# MNE-Python filtering functions with real data, consult the preprocessing
# tutorial on :ref:`tut-filter-resample`.
#
# Defaults in MNE-C
# -----------------
# MNE-C by default uses:
#
#    1. 5 Hz transition band for low-pass filters.
#    2. 3-sample transition band for high-pass filters.
#    3. Filter length of 8197 samples.
#
# The filter is designed in the frequency domain, creating a linear-phase
# filter such that the delay is compensated for as is done with the MNE-Python
# ``phase='zero'`` filtering option.
#
# Squared-cosine ramps are used in the transition regions. Because these
# are used in place of more gradual (e.g., linear) transitions,
# a given transition width will result in more temporal ringing but also more
# rapid attenuation than the same transition width in windowed FIR designs.
#
# The default filter length will generally have excellent attenuation
# but long ringing for the sample rates typically encountered in M/EEG data
# (e.g. 500-2000 Hz).
#
# Defaults in other software
# --------------------------
# A good but possibly outdated comparison of filtering in various software
# packages is available in Widmann *et al.* (2015) [7]_. Briefly:
#
# * EEGLAB
#     MNE-Python 0.14 defaults to behavior very similar to that of EEGLAB
#     (see the `EEGLAB filtering FAQ`_ for more information).
# * FieldTrip
#     By default FieldTrip applies a forward-backward Butterworth IIR filter
#     of order 4 (band-pass and band-stop filters) or 2 (for low-pass and
#     high-pass filters). Similar filters can be achieved in MNE-Python when
#     filtering with :meth:`raw.filter(..., method='iir') <mne.io.Raw.filter>`
#     (see also :func:`mne.filter.construct_iir_filter` for options).
#     For more information, see e.g. the
#     `FieldTrip band-pass documentation <ftbp_>`_.
#
# Reporting Filters
# =================
# On page 45 in Widmann *et al.* (2015) [7]_, there is a convenient list of
# important filter parameters that should be reported with each publication:
#
# 1. Filter type (high-pass, low-pass, band-pass, band-stop, FIR, IIR)
# 2. Cutoff frequency (including definition)
# 3. Filter order (or length)
# 4. Roll-off or transition bandwidth
# 5. Passband ripple and stopband attenuation
# 6. Filter delay (zero-phase, linear-phase, non-linear phase) and causality
# 7. Direction of computation (one-pass forward/reverse, or two-pass forward
#    and reverse)
#
# In the following, we will address how to deal with these parameters in MNE:
#
#
# Filter type
# -----------
# Depending on the function or method used, the filter type can be specified.
# To name an example, in :func:`mne.filter.create_filter`, the relevant
# arguments would be ``l_freq``, ``h_freq``, ``method``, and if the method is
# FIR ``fir_window`` and ``fir_design``.
#
#
# Cutoff frequency
# ----------------
# The cutoff of FIR filters in MNE is defined as half-amplitude cutoff in the
# middle of the transition band. That is, if you construct a lowpass FIR filter
# with ``h_freq = 40``, the filter function will provide a transition
# bandwidth that depends on the ``h_trans_bandwidth`` argument. The desired
# half-amplitude  cutoff of the lowpass FIR filter is then at
# ``h_freq + transition_bandwidth/2.``.
#
# Filter length (order) and transition bandwidth (roll-off)
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# In the :ref:`tut_filtering_in_python` section, we have already talked about
# the default filter lengths and transition bandwidths that are used when no
# custom values are specified using the respective filter function's arguments.
#
# If you want to find out about the filter length and transition bandwidth that
# were used through the 'auto' setting, you can use
# :func:`mne.filter.create_filter` to print out the settings once more:

# Use the same settings as when calling e.g., `raw.filter()`
fir_coefs = mne.filter.create_filter(
    data=None,  # data is only used for sanity checking, not strictly needed
    sfreq=1000.,  # sfreq of your data in Hz
    l_freq=None,
    h_freq=40.,  # assuming a lowpass of 40 Hz
    method='fir',
    fir_window='hamming',
    fir_design='firwin',
    verbose=True)

# See the printed log for the transition bandwidth and filter length.
# Alternatively, get the filter length through:
filter_length = fir_coefs.shape[0]

###############################################################################
# .. note:: If you are using an IIR filter, :func:`mne.filter.create_filter`
#           will not print a filter length and transition bandwidth to the log.
#           Instead, you can specify the roll-off with the ``iir_params``
#           argument or stay with the default, which is a fourth order
#           (Butterworth) filter.
#
# Passband ripple and stopband attenuation
# ----------------------------------------
#
# When use standard :func:`scipy.signal.firwin` design (as for FIR filters in
# MNE), the passband ripple and stopband attenuation are dependent upon the
# window used in design. For standard windows the values are listed in this
# table (see Ifeachor & Jervis (2002) [2]_, p. 357):
#
# +-------------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
# | Name of window function | Passband ripple | Stopband attenuation |
# +=========================+=================+======================+
# | Hann                    | 0.0545 dB       | 44 dB                |
# +-------------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
# | Hamming                 | 0.0194 dB       | 53 dB                |
# +-------------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
# | Blackman                | 0.0017 dB       | 74 dB                |
# +-------------------------+-----------------+----------------------+
#
#
# Filter delay and direction of computation
# -----------------------------------------
# For reporting this information, it might be sufficient to read the docstring
# of the filter function or method that you apply. For example in the
# docstring of `mne.filter.create_filter`, for the phase parameter it says:

#    Phase of the filter, only used if ``method='fir'``.
#    By default, a symmetric linear-phase FIR filter is constructed.
#    If ``phase='zero'`` (default), the delay of this filter
#    is compensated for. If ``phase=='zero-double'``, then this filter
#    is applied twice, once forward, and once backward. If 'minimum',
#    then a minimum-phase, causal filter will be used.

# Summary
# =======
#
# When filtering, there are always trade-offs that should be considered.
# One important trade-off is between time-domain characteristics (like ringing)
# and frequency-domain attenuation characteristics (like effective transition
# bandwidth). Filters with sharp frequency cutoffs can produce outputs that
# ring for a long time when they operate on signals with frequency content
# in the transition band. In general, therefore, the wider a transition band
# that can be tolerated, the better behaved the filter will be in the time
# domain.
