#
# Marking bad channels
# --------------------
#
# Sometimes some MEG or EEG channels are not functioning properly
# for various reasons. These channels should be excluded from
# analysis by marking them bad as. This is done by setting the 'bads'
# in the measurement info of a data container object (e.g. Raw, Epochs,
# Evoked). The info['bads'] value is a Python string. Here is
# example:

raw.info['bads'] = ['MEG 2443']

###############################################################################
# **Why setting a channel bad?**: If a channel does not show
# a signal at all (flat) it is important to exclude it from the
# analysis. If a channel as a noise level significantly higher than the
# other channels it should be marked as bad. Presence of bad channels
# can have terribe consequences on down stream analysis. For a flat channel
# some noise estimate will be unrealistically low and
# thus the current estimate calculations will give a strong weight
# to the zero signal on the flat channels and will essentially vanish.
# Noisy channels can also affect others when signal-space projections
# or EEG average electrode reference is employed. Noisy bad channels can
# also adversely affect averaging and noise-covariance matrix estimation by
# causing unnecessary rejections of epochs.
#
# Recommended ways to identify bad channels are:
#
# - Observe the quality of data during data
#   acquisition and make notes of observed malfunctioning channels to
#   your measurement protocol sheet.
#
# - View the on-line averages and check the condition of the channels.
#
# - Compute preliminary off-line averages with artifact rejection,
#   SSP/ICA, and EEG average electrode reference computation
#   off and check the condition of the channels.
#
# - View raw data with :func:`mne.io.Raw.plot` without SSP/ICA
#   enabled and identify bad channels.
#
# .. note::
#     Setting the bad channels should be done as early as possible in the
#     analysis pipeline. That's why it's recommended to set bad channels
#     the raw objects/files. If present in the raw data
#     files, the bad channel selections will be automatically transferred
#     to averaged files, noise-covariance matrices, forward solution
#     files, and inverse operator decompositions.
#
# The actual removal happens using :func:`pick_types <mne.pick_types>` with
# `exclude='bads'` option (see :ref:`picking_channels`).

###############################################################################
# Instead of removing the bad channels, you can also try to repair them.
# This is done by **interpolation** of the data from other channels.
# To illustrate how to use channel interpolation let us load some data.

# Reading data with a bad channel marked as bad:
fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis-ave.fif'
evoked = mne.read_evokeds(fname, condition='Left Auditory',
                          baseline=(None, 0))

# restrict the evoked to EEG and MEG channels
evoked.pick_types(meg=True, eeg=True, exclude=[])

# plot with bads
evoked.plot(exclude=[], time_unit='s')

print(evoked.info['bads'])

###############################################################################
# Let's now interpolate the bad channels (displayed in red above)
evoked.interpolate_bads(reset_bads=False, verbose=False)

###############################################################################
# Let's plot the cleaned data
evoked.plot(exclude=[], time_unit='s')

###############################################################################
# .. note::
#     Interpolation is a linear operation that can be performed also on
#     Raw and Epochs objects.
#
# For more details on interpolation see the page :ref:`channel_interpolation`.

# .. _marking_bad_segments:
#
# Marking bad raw segments with annotations
# -----------------------------------------
#
# MNE provides an :class:`mne.Annotations` class that can be used to mark
# segments of raw data and to reject epochs that overlap with bad segments
# of data. The annotations are automatically synchronized with raw data as
# long as the timestamps of raw data and annotations are in sync.
#
# See :ref:`tut-brainstorm-auditory`
# for a long example exploiting the annotations for artifact removal.
#
# The instances of annotations are created by providing a list of onsets and
# offsets with descriptions for each segment. The onsets and offsets are marked
# as seconds. ``onset`` refers to time from start of the data. ``offset`` is
# the duration of the annotation. The instance of :class:`mne.Annotations`
# can be added as an attribute of :class:`mne.io.Raw`.

eog_events = mne.preprocessing.find_eog_events(raw)
n_blinks = len(eog_events)
# Center to cover the whole blink with full duration of 0.5s:
onset = eog_events[:, 0] / raw.info['sfreq'] - 0.25
duration = np.repeat(0.5, n_blinks)
annot = mne.Annotations(onset, duration, ['bad blink'] * n_blinks,
                        orig_time=raw.info['meas_date'])
raw.set_annotations(annot)
print(raw.annotations)  # to get information about what annotations we have
raw.plot(events=eog_events)  # To see the annotated segments.

###############################################################################
# It is also possible to draw bad segments interactively using
# :meth:`raw.plot <mne.io.Raw.plot>` (see :ref:`tut-visualize-raw`).
#
# As the data is epoched, all the epochs overlapping with segments whose
# description starts with 'bad' are rejected by default. To turn rejection off,
# use keyword argument ``reject_by_annotation=False`` when constructing
# :class:`mne.Epochs`. When working with neuromag data, the ``first_samp``
# offset of raw acquisition is also taken into account the same way as with
# event lists. For more see :class:`mne.Epochs` and :class:`mne.Annotations`.

###############################################################################
# .. _rejecting_bad_epochs:
#
# Rejecting bad epochs
# --------------------
#
# When working with segmented data (Epochs) MNE offers a quite simple approach
# to automatically reject/ignore bad epochs. This is done by defining
# thresholds for peak-to-peak amplitude and flat signal detection.
#
# In the following code we build Epochs from Raw object. One of the provided
# parameter is named *reject*. It is a dictionary where every key is a
# channel type as a string and the corresponding values are peak-to-peak
# rejection parameters (amplitude ranges as floats). Below we define
# the peak-to-peak rejection values for gradiometers,
# magnetometers and EOG:

reject = dict(grad=4000e-13, mag=4e-12, eog=150e-6)

###############################################################################
# .. note::
#    The rejection values can be highly data dependent. You should be careful
#    when adjusting these values. Make sure not too many epochs are rejected
#    and look into the cause of the rejections. Maybe it's just a matter
#    of marking a single channel as bad and you'll be able to save a lot
#    of data.

###############################################################################
# We then construct the epochs
events = mne.find_events(raw, stim_channel='STI 014')
event_id = {"auditory/left": 1}
tmin = -0.2  # start of each epoch (200ms before the trigger)
tmax = 0.5  # end of each epoch (500ms after the trigger)
baseline = (None, 0)  # means from the first instant to t = 0
epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin, tmax, proj=True,
                    picks=['meg', 'eog'], baseline=baseline, reject=reject,
                    reject_by_annotation=True)

###############################################################################
# We then drop/reject the bad epochs
epochs.drop_bad()

###############################################################################
# And plot the so-called *drop log* that details the reason for which some
# epochs have been dropped.

print(epochs.drop_log[40:45])  # only a subset
epochs.plot_drop_log()

###############################################################################
# What you see is that some drop log values are empty. It means event was kept.
# If it says 'IGNORED' is means the event_id did not contain the associated
# event. If it gives the name of channel such as 'EOG 061' it means the
# epoch was rejected because 'EOG 061' exceeded the peak-to-peak rejection
# limit.
