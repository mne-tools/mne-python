   - The minimum numpy version has been increased to 1.6 from 1.4.

   - Deprecate `mne.fiff` module, use `mne.io` instead e.g. `mne.io.Raw` instead of `mne.fiff.Raw`.

   - Pick functions (e.g., `pick_types`) are now in the mne namespace (e.g. use `mne.pick_types`).

   - Deprecated ICA methods specfific to one container type. Use ICA.fit, ICA.get_sources ICA.apply and ICA.plot_XXX for processing Raw, Epochs and Evoked objects.

   - The default smoothing method for `mne.stc_to_label` will change in v0.9, and the old method is deprecated.

   - As default, for ICA the maximum number of PCA components equals the number of channels passed. The number of PCA components used to reconstruct the sensor space signals now defaults to the maximum number of PCA components estimated.

API
~~~
   - Added nave parameter to source_induced_power() and source_band_induced_power(), use nave=1 by default (wrong nave was used before).

   - Use mne.layout.read_layout instead of mne.layout.Layout to read a layout file (.lout)

   - Use raw.time_as_index instead of time_to_index (still works but is deprecated).

   - The artifacts module (mne.artifacts) is now merged into mne.preprocessing

   - Epochs objects now also take dicts as values for the event_id argument. They now can represent multiple conditions.
