Tutorials
=========

These tutorials provide narrative explanations, sample code, and expected
output for the most common MNE-Python analysis tasks. The emphasis here is on
thorough explanations that get you up to speed quickly, at the expense of
covering only a limited number of topics. The sections and tutorials are
arranged in a fixed order, so in theory a new user should be able to progress
through in order without encountering any cases where background
knowledge is assumed and unexplained. More experienced users (i.e., those with
significant experience analyzing EEG/MEG signals with different software) can
probably skip around to just the topics they need without too much trouble.
