Auto-generating ``Epochs`` metadata
===================================

This tutorial shows how to auto-generate metadata for `~mne.Epochs`, based on
events via `mne.epochs.make_metadata`.

We are going to use data from the :ref:`erp-core-dataset` (derived from
:footcite:`Kappenman2021`). This is EEG data from a single participant
performing an active visual task (Eriksen flanker task).

.. note::
   If you wish to skip the introductory parts of this tutorial, you may jump
   straight to :ref:`tut-autogenerate-metadata-ern` after completing the data
   import and event creation in the
   :ref:`tut-autogenerate-metadata-preparation` section.

This tutorial is loosely divided into two parts:

1. We will first focus on producing ERP time-locked to the **visual
   stimulation**, conditional on response correctness and response time in
   order to familiarize ourselves with the `~mne.epochs.make_metadata`
   function.
2. After that, we will calculate ERPs time-locked to the **responses** – again,
   conditional on response correctness – to visualize the error-related
   negativity (ERN), i.e. the ERP component associated with incorrect
   behavioral responses.


.. _tut-autogenerate-metadata-preparation:

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's start by reading, filtering, and producing a simple visualization of the
raw data. The data is pretty clean and contains very few blinks, so there's no
need to apply sophisticated preprocessing and data cleaning procedures.
We will also convert the `~mne.Annotations` contained in this dataset to events
by calling `mne.events_from_annotations`.

# Creating metadata from events
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# The basics of ``make_metadata``
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# Now it's time to think about the time windows to use for epoching and
# metadata generation. **It is important to understand that these time windows
# need not be the same!** That is, the automatically generated metadata might
# include information about events from only a fraction of the epochs duration;
# or it might include events that occurred well outside a given epoch.
#
# Let us look at a concrete example. In the Flankers task of the ERP CORE
# dataset, participants were required to respond to visual stimuli by pressing
# a button. We're interested in looking at the visual evoked responses (ERPs)
# of trials with correct responses. Assume that based on literature
# studies, we decide that responses later than 1500 ms after stimulus onset are
# to be considered invalid, because they don't capture the neuronal processes
# of interest here. We can approach this  in the following way with the help of
# `mne.epochs.make_metadata`:

# metadata for each epoch shall include events from the range: [0.0, 1.5] s,
# i.e. starting with stimulus onset and expanding beyond the end of the epoch
metadata_tmin, metadata_tmax = 0.0, 1.5

# auto-create metadata
# this also returns a new events array and an event_id dictionary. we'll see
# later why this is important
metadata, events, event_id = mne.epochs.make_metadata(
    events=all_events, event_id=all_event_id,
    tmin=metadata_tmin, tmax=metadata_tmax, sfreq=raw.info['sfreq'])

# let's look at what we got!
metadata

###############################################################################
# Specifying time-locked events
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We can see that the generated table has 802 rows, each one corresponding to
# an individual event in ``all_events``. The first column, ``event_name``,
# contains the name of the respective event around which the metadata of that
# specific column was generated – we'll call that the "time-locked event",
# because we'll assign it time point zero.
#
# The names of the remaining columns correspond to the event names specified in
# the ``all_event_id`` dictionary. These columns contain floats; the values
# represent the latency of that specific event in seconds, relative to
# the time-locked event (the one mentioned in the ``event_name`` column).
# For events that didn't occur within the given time window, you'll see
# a value of ``NaN``, simply indicating that no event latency could be
# extracted.
#
# Now, there's a problem here. We want investigate the visual ERPs only,
# conditional on responses. But the metadata that was just created contains
# one row for **every** event, including responses. While we **could** create
# epochs for all events, allowing us to pass those metadata, and later subset
# the created events, there's a more elegant way to handle things:
# `~mne.epochs.make_metadata` has a ``row_events`` parameter that
# allows us to specify for which events to create metadata **rows**, while
# still creating **columns for all events** in the ``event_id`` dictionary.
#
# Because the metadata, then, only pertains to a subset of our original events,
# it's important to keep the returned ``events`` and ``event_id`` around for
# later use when we're actually going to create our epochs, to ensure that
# metadata, events, and event descriptions stay in sync.

row_events = ['stimulus/compatible/target_left',
              'stimulus/compatible/target_right',
              'stimulus/incompatible/target_left',
              'stimulus/incompatible/target_right']

metadata, events, event_id = mne.epochs.make_metadata(
    events=all_events, event_id=all_event_id,
    tmin=metadata_tmin, tmax=metadata_tmax, sfreq=raw.info['sfreq'],
    row_events=row_events)

###############################################################################
# Keeping only the first events of a group
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# The metadata now contains 400 rows – one per stimulation – and the same
# number of columns as before. Great!
#
# We have two types of responses in our data: ``response/left`` and
# ``response/right``. We would like to map those to "correct" and "incorrect".
# To make this easier, we can ask `~mne.epochs.make_metadata` to generate an
# entirely **new** column that refers to the first response observed during the
# given time interval. This works by passing a subset of the
# :term:`hierarchical event descriptors` (HEDs, inspired by
# :footcite:`BigdelyShamloEtAl2013`) used to name events via the ``keep_first``
# parameter. For example, in the case of the HEDs ``response/left`` and
# ``response/right``, we could pass ``keep_first='response'`` to generate a new
# column, ``response``, containing the latency of the respective event. This
# value pertains only the first (or, in this specific example: the only)
# response, regardless of side (left or right). To indicate **which** event
# type (here: response side) was matched, a second column is added:
# ``first_response``. The values in this column are the event types without the
# string used for matching, as it is already encoded as the column name, i.e.
# in our example, we expect it to only contain ``'left'`` and ``'right'``.

keep_first = 'response'
metadata, events, event_id = mne.epochs.make_metadata(
    events=all_events, event_id=all_event_id,
    tmin=metadata_tmin, tmax=metadata_tmax, sfreq=raw.info['sfreq'],
    row_events=row_events,
    keep_first=keep_first)

# visualize response times regardless of side
metadata['response'].plot.hist(bins=50, title='Response Times')

# the "first_response" column contains only "left" and "right" entries, derived
# from the initial event named "response/left" and "response/right"
print(metadata['first_response'])

###############################################################################
# We're facing a similar issue with the stimulus events, and now there are not
# only two, but **four** different types: ``stimulus/compatible/target_left``,
# ``stimulus/compatible/target_right``, ``stimulus/incompatible/target_left``,
# and ``stimulus/incompatible/target_right``. Even more, because in the present
# paradigm stimuli were presented in rapid succession, sometimes multiple
# stimulus events occurred within the 1.5 second time window we're using to
# generate our metadata. See for example:

metadata.loc[metadata['stimulus/compatible/target_left'].notna() &
             metadata['stimulus/compatible/target_right'].notna(),
             :]

###############################################################################
# This can easily lead to confusion during later stages of processing, so let's
# create a column for the first stimulus – which will always be the time-locked
# stimulus, as our time interval starts at 0 seconds. We can pass a **list** of
# strings to ``keep_first``.

keep_first = ['stimulus', 'response']
metadata, events, event_id = mne.epochs.make_metadata(
    events=all_events, event_id=all_event_id,
    tmin=metadata_tmin, tmax=metadata_tmax, sfreq=raw.info['sfreq'],
    row_events=row_events,
    keep_first=keep_first)

# all times of the time-locked events should be zero
assert all(metadata['stimulus'] == 0)

# the values in the new "first_stimulus" and "first_response" columns indicate
# which events were selected via "keep_first"

# We first add a column encoding the side of stimulation, and then simply
# check whether the response matches the stimulation side, and add this result
# to another column.

                                              'incompatible/target_left']),

# remember to pass ``events`` and ``event_id`` as returned from
# `~mne.epochs.make_metadata`, as we only created metadata for a subset of
# our original events by passing ``row_events``. Otherwise, the length
# of the metadata and the number of epochs would not match and MNE-Python
# would raise an error.

# the right stimulus-response pairings. We can achieve this by passing the
