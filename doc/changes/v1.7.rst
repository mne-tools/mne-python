Version 1.7.0 (2024-04-19)
==========================

Notable changes
---------------

- In this version, we started adding type hints (also known as "type annotations") to select parts of the codebase.
  This meta information will be used by development environments (IDEs) like VS Code and PyCharm automatically to provide
  better assistance such as tab completion or error detection even before running your code.

  So far, we've only added return type hints to :func:`mne.io.read_raw`, :func:`mne.read_epochs`, :func:`mne.read_evokeds` and
  all format-specific ``read_raw_*()`` and ``read_epochs_*()`` functions. Now your editors will know:
  these functions return evoked and raw data, respectively. We are planning add type hints to more functions after careful
  evaluation in the future.

  You don't need to do anything to benefit from these changes – your editor will pick them up automatically and provide the
  enhanced experience if it supports it! (`#12250 <https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pulls/12250>`__)
