Thanks for contributing a pull request! Please make sure you have read the
[contribution guidelines](https://mne.tools/dev/development/contributing.html)
before submitting.

Please be aware that we are a loose team of volunteers so patience is
necessary. Assistance handling other issues is very welcome. We value
all user contributions, no matter how minor they are. If we are slow to
review, either the pull request needs some benchmarking, tinkering,
convincing, etc. or more likely the reviewers are simply busy. In either
case, we ask for your understanding during the review process.

Again, thanks for contributing!
