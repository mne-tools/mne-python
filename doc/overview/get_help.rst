Getting help
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three main channels for obtaining help with MNE software tools.

The `MNE mailing list`_ and `MNE gitter channel`_ are a good place to start for
both troubleshooting and general questions.  If you want to request new
features or if you're confident that you have found a bug, please create a new
issue on the `GitHub issues page`_. When reporting bugs, please try to
replicate the bug with the MNE-Python :ref:`sample data <sample-dataset>`, and
make every effort to simplify your example script to only the elements
necessary to replicate the bug.
