Setting the EEG reference
=========================

This tutorial describes how to set or change the EEG reference in MNE-Python.

As usual we'll start by importing the modules we need, loading some
:ref:`example data <sample-dataset>`, and cropping it to save memory. Since
this tutorial deals specifically with EEG, we'll also restrict the dataset to
just a few EEG channels so the plots are easier to see:
"""

import os
import mne

sample_data_folder = mne.datasets.sample.data_path()
sample_data_raw_file = os.path.join(sample_data_folder, 'MEG', 'sample',
                                    'sample_audvis_raw.fif')
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(sample_data_raw_file, verbose=False)
raw.crop(tmax=60).load_data()
raw.pick(['EEG 0{:02}'.format(n) for n in range(41, 60)])

# Background
# ^^^^^^^^^^
#
# EEG measures a voltage (difference in electric potential) between each
# electrode and a reference electrode. This means that whatever signal is
# present at the reference electrode is effectively subtracted from all the
# measurement electrodes. Therefore, an ideal reference signal is one that
# captures *none* of the brain-specific fluctuations in electric potential,
# while capturing *all* of the environmental noise/interference that is being
# picked up by the measurement electrodes.
#
# In practice, this means that the reference electrode is often placed in a
# location on the subject's body and close to their head (so that any
# environmental interference affects the reference and measurement electrodes
# similarly) but as far away from the neural sources as possible (so that the
# reference signal doesn't pick up brain-based fluctuations). Typical reference
# locations are the subject's earlobe, nose, mastoid process, or collarbone.
# Each of these has advantages and disadvantages regarding how much brain
# signal it picks up (e.g., the mastoids pick up a fair amount compared to the
# others), and regarding the environmental noise it picks up (e.g., earlobe
# electrodes may shift easily, and have signals more similar to electrodes on
# the same side of the head).
#
# Even in cases where no electrode is specifically designated as the reference,
# EEG recording hardware will still treat one of the scalp electrodes as the
# reference, and the recording software may or may not display it to you (it
# might appear as a completely flat channel, or the software might subtract out
# the average of all signals before displaying, making it *look like* there is
# no reference).
#
#
# Setting or changing the reference channel
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If you want to recompute your data with a different reference than was used
# when the raw data were recorded and/or saved, MNE-Python provides the
# :meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_eeg_reference` method on :class:`~mne.io.Raw` objects
# as well as the :func:`mne.add_reference_channels` function. To use an
# existing channel as the new reference, use the
# :meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_eeg_reference` method; you can also designate multiple
# existing electrodes as reference channels, as is sometimes done with mastoid
# references:

# code lines below are commented out because the sample data doesn't have
# earlobe or mastoid channels, so this is just for demonstration purposes:

# use a single channel reference (left earlobe)
# raw.set_eeg_reference(ref_channels=['A1'])

# use average of mastoid channels as reference
# raw.set_eeg_reference(ref_channels=['M1', 'M2'])

# use a bipolar reference (contralateral)
# raw.set_bipolar_reference(anode='[F3'], cathode=['F4'])

###############################################################################
# If a scalp electrode was used as reference but was not saved alongside the
# raw data (reference channels often aren't), you may wish to add it back to
# the dataset before re-referencing. For example, if your EEG system recorded
# with channel ``Fp1`` as the reference but did not include ``Fp1`` in the data
# file, using :meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_eeg_reference` to set (say) ``Cz`` as the
# new reference will then subtract out the signal at ``Cz`` *without restoring
# the signal at* ``Fp1``. In this situation, you can add back ``Fp1`` as a flat
# channel prior to re-referencing using :func:`~mne.add_reference_channels`.
# (Since our example data doesn't use the `10-20 electrode naming system`_, the
# example below adds ``EEG 999`` as the missing reference, then sets the
# reference to ``EEG 050``.) Here's how the data looks in its original state:

raw.plot()

###############################################################################
# By default, :func:`~mne.add_reference_channels` returns a copy, so we can go
# back to our original ``raw`` object later. If you wanted to alter the
# existing :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object in-place you could specify
# ``copy=False``.

# add new reference channel (all zero)
raw_new_ref = mne.add_reference_channels(raw, ref_channels=['EEG 999'])
raw_new_ref.plot()

###############################################################################
# .. KEEP THESE BLOCKS SEPARATE SO FIGURES ARE BIG ENOUGH TO READ

# set reference to `EEG 050`
raw_new_ref.set_eeg_reference(ref_channels=['EEG 050'])
raw_new_ref.plot()

###############################################################################
# Notice that the new reference (``EEG 050``) is now flat, while the original
# reference channel that we added back to the data (``EEG 999``) has a non-zero
# signal. Notice also that ``EEG 053`` (which is marked as "bad" in
# ``raw.info['bads']``) is not affected by the re-referencing.
#
#
# Setting average reference
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# To set a "virtual reference" that is the average of all channels, you can use
# :meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_eeg_reference` with ``ref_channels='average'``. Just
# as above, this will not affect any channels marked as "bad", nor will it
# include bad channels when computing the average. However, it does modify the
# :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object in-place, so we'll make a copy first so we can
# still go back to the unmodified :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object later:

# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 4
# use the average of all channels as reference
raw_avg_ref = raw.copy().set_eeg_reference(ref_channels='average')
raw_avg_ref.plot()

###############################################################################
# Creating the average reference as a projector
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If using an average reference, it is possible to create the reference as a
# :term:`projector` rather than subtracting the reference from the data
# immediately by specifying ``projection=True``:

raw.set_eeg_reference('average', projection=True)
print(raw.info['projs'])

###############################################################################
# Creating the average reference as a projector has a few advantages:
#
# 1. It is possible to turn projectors on or off when plotting, so it is easy
#    to visualize the effect that the average reference has on the data.
#
# 2. If additional channels are marked as "bad" or if a subset of channels are
#    later selected, the projector will be re-computed to take these changes
#    into account (thus guaranteeing that the signal is zero-mean).
#
# 3. If there are other unapplied projectors affecting the EEG channels (such
#    as SSP projectors for removing heartbeat or blink artifacts), EEG
#    re-referencing cannot be performed until those projectors are either
#    applied or removed; adding the EEG reference as a projector is not subject
#    to that constraint. (The reason this wasn't a problem when we applied the
#    non-projector average reference to ``raw_avg_ref`` above is that the
#    empty-room projectors included in the sample data :file:`.fif` file were
#    only computed for the magnetometers.)

for title, proj in zip(['Original', 'Average'], [False, True]):
    fig = raw.plot(proj=proj, n_channels=len(raw))
    # make room for title
    fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)
    fig.suptitle('{} reference'.format(title), size='xx-large', weight='bold')

###############################################################################
# Using an infinite reference (REST)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# To use the "point at infinity" reference technique described in
# :footcite:`Yao2001` requires a forward model, which we can create in a few
# steps. Here we use a fairly large spacing of vertices (``pos`` = 15 mm) to
# reduce computation time; a 5 mm spacing is more typical for real data
# analysis:

raw.del_proj()  # remove our average reference projector first
sphere = mne.make_sphere_model('auto', 'auto', raw.info)
src = mne.setup_volume_source_space(sphere=sphere, exclude=30., pos=15.)
forward = mne.make_forward_solution(raw.info, trans=None, src=src, bem=sphere)
raw_rest = raw.copy().set_eeg_reference('REST', forward=forward)

for title, _raw in zip(['Original', 'REST (âˆž)'], [raw, raw_rest]):
    fig = _raw.plot(n_channels=len(raw), scalings=dict(eeg=5e-5))
    # make room for title
    fig.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)
    fig.suptitle('{} reference'.format(title), size='xx-large', weight='bold')

###############################################################################
# Using a bipolar reference
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# To create a bipolar reference, you can use :meth:`~mne.set_bipolar_reference`
# along with the respective channel names for ``anode`` and ``cathode`` which
# creates a new virtual channel that takes the difference between two
# specified channels (anode and cathode) and drops the original channels by
# default. The new virtual channel will be annotated with the channel info of
# the anode with location set to ``(0, 0, 0)`` and coil type set to
# ``EEG_BIPOLAR`` by default. Here we use a contralateral/transverse bipolar
# reference between channels ``EEG 054`` and ``EEG 055`` as described in
# :footcite:`YaoEtAl2019` which creates a new virtual channel
# named ``EEG 054-EEG 055``.

raw_bip_ref = mne.set_bipolar_reference(raw, anode=['EEG 054'],
                                        cathode=['EEG 055'])
raw_bip_ref.plot()

# EEG reference and source modeling
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If you plan to perform source modeling (either with EEG or combined EEG/MEG
# data), it is **strongly recommended** to use the
# average-reference-as-projection approach. It is important to use an average
# reference because using a specific
# reference sensor (or even an average of a few sensors) spreads the forward
# model error from the reference sensor(s) into all sensors, effectively
# amplifying the importance of the reference sensor(s) when computing source
# estimates. In contrast, using the average of all EEG channels as reference
# spreads the forward modeling error evenly across channels, so no one channel
# is weighted more strongly during source estimation. See also this `FieldTrip
# FAQ on average referencing`_ for more information.
#
# The main reason for specifying the average reference as a projector was
# mentioned in the previous section: an average reference projector adapts if
# channels are dropped, ensuring that the signal will always be zero-mean when
# the source modeling is performed. In contrast, applying an average reference
# by the traditional subtraction method offers no such guarantee.
#
# For these reasons, when performing inverse imaging, *MNE-Python will raise
# a ``ValueError`` if there are EEG channels present and something other than
# an average reference strategy has been specified*.
