====================================================
Locating micro-scale intracranial electrode contacts
====================================================

When intracranial electrode contacts are very small, sometimes
the computed tomography (CT) scan is higher resolution than the
magnetic resonance (MR) image and so you want to find the contacts
on the CT without downsampling to the MR resolution. This example
shows how to do this.

# could apply the head->mri transform directly but that relies of the
# fiducial points being marked exactly the same on the CT as on the MRI--
# the error from this is not precise enough for intracranial electrophysiology,
