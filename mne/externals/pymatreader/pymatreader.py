This is a small module intended to facilitate reading .mat files containing
large data structures into python, disregarding of the underlying .mat
file version.

    """This function reads .mat files of version <7.3 or 7.3 and returns the
    contained data structure as a dictionary of nested substructure similar
    to scipy.io.loadmat style.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename: str
        Path and filename of the .mat file containing the data.
    variable_names: list of strings, optional
        Reads only the data contained in the specified dict key or
        variable name. Default is None.
    ignore_fields: list of strings, optional
        Ignores every dict key/variable name specified in the list within the
        entire structure. Only works for .mat files v 7.3. Default is [].
    uint16_codec : str | None
        If your file contains non-ascii characters, sometimes reading
        it may fail and give rise to error message stating that "buffer is
        too small". ``uint16_codec`` allows to specify what codec (for example:
        'latin1' or 'utf-8') should be used when reading character arrays and
        can therefore help you solve this problem.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A structure of nested dictionaries, with variable names as keys and
        variable data as values.
