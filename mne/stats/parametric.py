    Performs a 1-way ANOVA.

    The one-way ANOVA tests the null hypothesis that 2 or more groups have
    the same population mean.  The test is applied to samples from two or
    more groups, possibly with differing sizes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1, sample2, ... : array_like
        The sample measurements should be given as arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    F-value : float
        The computed F-value of the test
    p-value : float
        The associated p-value from the F-distribution

    Notes
    -----
    The ANOVA test has important assumptions that must be satisfied in order
    for the associated p-value to be valid.

    1. The samples are independent
    2. Each sample is from a normally distributed population
    3. The population standard deviations of the groups are all equal.  This
       property is known as homocedasticity.

    If these assumptions are not true for a given set of data, it may still be
    possible to use the Kruskal-Wallis H-test (`stats.kruskal`_) although with
    some loss of power

    The algorithm is from Heiman[2], pp.394-7.

    See scipy.stats.f_oneway that should give the same results while
    being less efficient
