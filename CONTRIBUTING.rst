Contributing to MNE-Python
==========================

MNE-Python is maintained by a community of scientists and research labs, and
accepts contributions in the form of bug reports, fixes, feature additions, and
documentation improvements (even just typo corrections). The best way to start
contributing is by `opening an issue`_ on our GitHub page to discuss your ideas
for changes or enhancements, or to tell us about behavior that you think might
be a bug in MNE-Python. *For general usage questions and troubleshooting of
scripts that use MNE-Python*, you should instead use `GitHub Discussions`_,
write to the `MNE mailing list`_ or chat with developers on the
`MNE Gitter channel`_. Users and contributors to MNE-Python are expected to
follow our `code of conduct`_.

The `contributing guide`_ has details on the preferred contribution workflow
and how best to configure your system for a smooth experience contributing to
MNE-Python.
