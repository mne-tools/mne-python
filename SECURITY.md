## Reporting a Vulnerability

MNE-Python is software for analysis and visualization of brain activity
recorded with a variety of devices/modalities (EEG, MEG, ECoG, fNIRS, etc).
It is not expected that using MNE-Python will lead to security
vulnerabilities under normal use cases (i.e., running without administrator
privileges). However, if you think you have found a security vulnerability
in MNE-Python, please report it to [TODO: INSERT PRIVATE DEVS EMAIL HERE?].
