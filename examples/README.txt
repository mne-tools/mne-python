Examples Gallery
================

The examples gallery provides working code samples demonstrating various
analysis and visualization techniques. These examples often lack the narrative
explanations seen in the tutorials, and do not follow any specific order. These
examples are a useful way to discover new analysis or plotting ideas, or to see
how a particular technique youâ€™ve read about can be applied using MNE-Python.

.. note::
    If example-scripts contain plots and are run locally, using the
    interactive interactive flag with ``python -i tutorial_script.py``
    keeps them open.

.. warning::

   These examples sometimes use simulations or shortcuts (such as intentionally
   adding noise to recordings) to illustrate a point. Use caution when
   copy-pasting code samples.
