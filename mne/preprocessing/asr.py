class ASR():
    """Artifact Subspace Reconstruction.

    Artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) is an automatic, online,
    component-based artifact removal method for removing transient or
    large-amplitude artifacts in multi-channel EEG recordings [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sfreq : float
        Sampling rate of the data, in Hz.

    The following are optional parameters (the key parameter of the method is
    the ``cutoff``):

    cutoff: float
        Standard deviation cutoff for rejection. X portions whose variance
        is larger than this threshold relative to the calibration data are
        considered missing data and will be removed. The most aggressive value
        that can be used without losing too much EEG is 2.5. A quite
        conservative value would be 5 (default=5).
    blocksize : int
        Block size for calculating the robust data covariance and thresholds,
        in samples; allows to reduce the memory and time requirements of the
        robust estimators by this factor (down to Channels x Channels x Samples
        x 16 / Blocksize bytes) (default=10).
    win_len : float
        Window length (s) that is used to check the data for artifact content.
        This is ideally as long as the expected time scale of the artifacts but
        not shorter than half a cycle of the high-pass filter that was used
        (default=1).
    win_overlap : float
        Window overlap fraction. The fraction of two successive windows that
        overlaps. Higher overlap ensures that fewer artifact portions are going
        to be missed, but is slower (default=0.66).
    max_dropout_fraction : float
        Maximum fraction of windows that can be subject to signal dropouts
        (e.g., sensor unplugged), used for threshold estimation (default=0.1).
    min_clean_fraction : float
        Minimum fraction of windows that need to be clean, used for threshold
        estimation (default=0.25).
    method : {'riemann', 'euclid'}
        Method to use. If riemann, use the riemannian-modified version of
        ASR [2]_.
    memory : float
        Memory size (s), regulates the number of covariance matrices to store.
    estimator : str in {'scm', 'lwf', 'oas', 'mcd'}
        Covariance estimator (default: 'scm' which computes the sample
        covariance). Use 'lwf' if you need regularization (requires pyriemann).

    Attributes
    ----------
    ``state_`` : dict
        Initial state of the ASR filter.
    ``zi_``: array, shape=(n_channels, filter_order)
        Filter initial conditions.
    ``ab_``: 2-tuple
        Coefficients of an IIR filter that is used to shape the spectrum of the
        signal when calculating artifact statistics. The output signal does not
        go through this filter. This is an optional way to tune the sensitivity
        of the algorithm to each frequency component of the signal. The default
        filter is less sensitive at alpha and beta frequencies and more
        sensitive at delta (blinks) and gamma (muscle) frequencies.
    ``cov_`` : array, shape=(channels, channels)
        Previous covariance matrix.
    ``state_`` : dict
        Previous ASR parameters (as derived by :func:`asr_calibrate`) for
        successive calls to :meth:`transform`. Required fields are:

        - ``M`` : Mixing matrix
        - ``T`` : Threshold matrix
        - ``R`` : Reconstruction matrix (array | None)

    This function cuts segments from the data which contain high-power

    its power is above or below a given upper/lower threshold (in standard
    deviations from a robust estimate of the EEG power distribution in the
    channel).

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array, shape=(n_channels, n_samples)
        Continuous data set, assumed to be appropriately high-passed (e.g. >
        1Hz or 0.5Hz - 2.0Hz transition band)
    max_bad_chans : float
        The maximum number or fraction of bad channels that a retained window
        may still contain (more than this and it is removed). Reasonable range
        is 0.05 (very clean output) to 0.3 (very lax cleaning of only coarse
        artifacts) (default=0.2).
    zthresholds : 2-tuple
        The minimum and maximum standard deviations within which the power of a
        channel must lie (relative to a robust estimate of the clean EEG power
        distribution in the channel) for it to be considered "not bad".
        (default=[-3.5, 5]).

    The following are detail parameters that usually do not have to be tuned.
    If you can't get the function to do what you want, you might consider
    adapting these to your data.

    win_len : float
        Window length that is used to check the data for artifact content. This
        is ideally as long as the expected time scale of the artifacts but not
        shorter than half a cycle of the high-pass filter that was used.
        Default: 1.
    win_overlap : float
        Window overlap fraction. The fraction of two successive windows that
        overlaps. Higher overlap ensures that fewer artifact portions are going
        to be missed, but is slower (default=0.66).
    max_dropout_fraction : float
        Maximum fraction that can have dropouts. This is the maximum fraction
        of time windows that may have arbitrarily low amplitude (e.g., due to
        the sensors being unplugged) (default=0.1).
    min_clean_fraction : float
        Minimum fraction that needs to be clean. This is the minimum fraction
        of time windows that need to contain essentially uncontaminated EEG.
        (default=0.25)

    The following are expert-level parameters that you should not tune unless
    you fully understand how the method works.

    truncate_quant :
        Truncated Gaussian quantile. Quantile range [upper,lower] of the
        truncated Gaussian distribution that shall be fit to the EEG contents.
        (default=[0.022, 0.6])
    step_sizes :
        Grid search stepping. Step size of the grid search, in quantiles;
        separately for [lower,upper] edge of the truncated Gaussian. The lower
        edge has finer stepping because the clean data density is assumed to be
        lower there, so small changes in quantile amount to large changes in
        data space (default=[0.01 0.01]).
    shape_range :
        Shape parameter range. Search range for the shape parameter of the
        generalized Gaussian distribution used to fit clean EEG (default:
        1.7:0.15:3.5).

    Returns
    -------
    clean : array, shape=(n_channels, n_samples)
        Dataset with bad time periods removed.
    sample_mask : boolean array, shape=(1, n_samples)
        Mask of retained samples (logical array).

        in samples; allows to reduce the memory and time requirements of the
        robust estimators by this factor (down to n_chans x n_chans x n_samples
        x 16 / blocksize bytes) (default=100).
    win_len : float
        Window length that is used to check the data for artifact content. This
        is ideally as long as the expected time scale of the artifacts but
        short enough to allow for several 1000 windows to compute statistics
        over (default=0.5).
    win_overlap : float
        Window overlap fraction. The fraction of two successive windows that
        overlaps. Higher overlap ensures that fewer artifact portions are going
        to be missed, but is slower (default=0.66).
    max_dropout_fraction : float
        Maximum fraction of windows that can be subject to signal dropouts
        (e.g., sensor unplugged), used for threshold estimation (default=0.1).
    min_clean_fraction : float
        Minimum fraction of windows that need to be clean, used for threshold
        estimation (default=0.25).
    method : {'euclid', 'riemann'}
        Metric to compute the covariance matric average.

    Returns
    -------
    M : array
        Mixing matrix.
    T : array
        Threshold matrix.

    This function is used to clean multi-channel signal using the ASR method.
    The required inputs are the data matrix, the sampling rate of the data, and
    the filter state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array, shape=([n_trials, ]n_channels, n_samples)
        Raw data.
    X_filt : array, shape=([n_trials, ]n_channels, n_samples)
        Yulewalk-filtered epochs to estimate covariance. Optional if covariance
        is provided.
    state : dict
