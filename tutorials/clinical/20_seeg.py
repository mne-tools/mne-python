======================
Working with sEEG data
======================

MNE-Python supports working with more than just MEG and EEG data. Here we show
some of the functions that can be used to facilitate working with
stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data.

This example shows how to use:

- sEEG data
- channel locations in MNI space
- projection into a volume

Note that our sample sEEG electrodes are already assumed to be in MNI
space. If you want to map positions from your subject MRI space to MNI
fsaverage space, you must apply the FreeSurfer's talairach.xfm transform
for your dataset. You can take a look at :ref:`tut-freesurfer-mne` for
more information.

For an example that involves ECoG data, channel locations in a
subject-specific MRI, or projection into a surface, see
:ref:`tut-working-with-ecog`. In the ECoG example, we show
how to visualize surface grid channels on the brain.
