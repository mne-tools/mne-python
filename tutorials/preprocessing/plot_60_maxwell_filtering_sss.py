Signal-space separation (SSS) and Maxwell filtering
===================================================

This tutorial covers reducing environmental noise and compensating for head
movement with SSS and Maxwell filtering.

As usual we'll start by importing the modules we need, loading some
:ref:`example data <sample-dataset>`, and cropping it to save on memory:
"""

import os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import mne
from mne.preprocessing import find_bad_channels_maxwell

sample_data_folder = mne.datasets.sample.data_path()
sample_data_raw_file = os.path.join(sample_data_folder, 'MEG', 'sample',
                                    'sample_audvis_raw.fif')
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(sample_data_raw_file, verbose=False)
raw.crop(tmax=60)

# Background on SSS and Maxwell filtering
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Signal-space separation (SSS) :footcite:`TauluKajola2005,TauluSimola2006`
# is a technique based on the physics
# of electromagnetic fields. SSS separates the measured signal into components
# attributable to sources *inside* the measurement volume of the sensor array
# (the *internal components*), and components attributable to sources *outside*
# the measurement volume (the *external components*). The internal and external
# components are linearly independent, so it is possible to simply discard the
# external components to reduce environmental noise. *Maxwell filtering* is a
# related procedure that omits the higher-order components of the internal
# subspace, which are dominated by sensor noise. Typically, Maxwell filtering
# and SSS are performed together (in MNE-Python they are implemented together
# in a single function).
#
# Like :ref:`SSP <tut-artifact-ssp>`, SSS is a form of projection. Whereas SSP
# empirically determines a noise subspace based on data (empty-room recordings,
# EOG or ECG activity, etc) and projects the measurements onto a subspace
# orthogonal to the noise, SSS mathematically constructs the external and
# internal subspaces from `spherical harmonics`_ and reconstructs the sensor
# signals using only the internal subspace (i.e., does an oblique projection).
#
# .. warning::
#
#     Maxwell filtering was originally developed for Elekta Neuromag® systems,
#     and should be considered *experimental* for non-Neuromag data. See the
#     Notes section of the :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter` docstring
#     for details.
#
# The MNE-Python implementation of SSS / Maxwell filtering currently provides
# the following features:
#
# - Basic bad channel detection
#   (:func:`~mne.preprocessing.find_bad_channels_maxwell`)
# - Bad channel reconstruction
# - Cross-talk cancellation
# - Fine calibration correction
# - tSSS
# - Coordinate frame translation
# - Regularization of internal components using information theory
# - Raw movement compensation (using head positions estimated by MaxFilter)
# - cHPI subtraction (see :func:`mne.chpi.filter_chpi`)
# - Handling of 3D (in addition to 1D) fine calibration files
# - Epoch-based movement compensation as described in
#   :footcite:`TauluKajola2005` through :func:`mne.epochs.average_movements`
# - **Experimental** processing of data from (un-compensated) non-Elekta
#   systems
#
#
# Using SSS and Maxwell filtering in MNE-Python
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# For optimal use of SSS with data from Elekta Neuromag® systems, you should
# provide the path to the fine calibration file (which encodes site-specific
# information about sensor orientation and calibration) as well as a crosstalk
# compensation file (which reduces interference between Elekta's co-located
# magnetometer and paired gradiometer sensor units).

fine_cal_file = os.path.join(sample_data_folder, 'SSS', 'sss_cal_mgh.dat')
crosstalk_file = os.path.join(sample_data_folder, 'SSS', 'ct_sparse_mgh.fif')

###############################################################################
# Before we perform SSS we'll look for bad channels — ``MEG 2443`` is quite
# noisy.
#
# .. warning::
#
#     It is critical to mark bad channels in ``raw.info['bads']`` *before*
#     calling :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter` in order to prevent
#     bad channel noise from spreading.
#
# Let's see if we can automatically detect it.

raw.info['bads'] = []
raw_check = raw.copy()
auto_noisy_chs, auto_flat_chs, auto_scores = find_bad_channels_maxwell(
    raw_check, cross_talk=crosstalk_file, calibration=fine_cal_file,
    return_scores=True, verbose=True)
print(auto_noisy_chs)  # we should find them!
print(auto_flat_chs)  # none for this dataset

###############################################################################
#
# .. note:: `~mne.preprocessing.find_bad_channels_maxwell` needs to operate on
#           a signal without line noise or cHPI signals. By default, it simply
#           applies a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 40 Hz to the
#           data, which should remove these artifacts. You may also specify a
#           different cutoff by passing the ``h_freq`` keyword argument. If you
#           set ``h_freq=None``, no filtering will be applied. This can be
#           useful if your data has already been preconditioned, for example
#           using :func:`mne.chpi.filter_chpi`,
#           :func:`mne.io.Raw.notch_filter`, or :meth:`mne.io.Raw.filter`.
#
# Now we can update the list of bad channels in the dataset.

bads = raw.info['bads'] + auto_noisy_chs + auto_flat_chs
raw.info['bads'] = bads

###############################################################################
# We called `~mne.preprocessing.find_bad_channels_maxwell` with the optional
# keyword argument ``return_scores=True``, causing the function to return a
# dictionary of all data related to the scoring used to classify channels as
# noisy or flat. This information can be used to produce diagnostic figures.
#
# In the following, we will generate such visualizations for
# the automated detection of *noisy* gradiometer channels.

# Only select the data forgradiometer channels.
ch_type = 'grad'
ch_subset = auto_scores['ch_types'] == ch_type
ch_names = auto_scores['ch_names'][ch_subset]
scores = auto_scores['scores_noisy'][ch_subset]
limits = auto_scores['limits_noisy'][ch_subset]
bins = auto_scores['bins']  # The the windows that were evaluated.
# We will label each segment by its start and stop time, with up to 3
# digits before and 3 digits after the decimal place (1 ms precision).
bin_labels = [f'{start:3.3f} – {stop:3.3f}'
              for start, stop in bins]

# We store the data in a Pandas DataFrame. The seaborn heatmap function
# we will call below will then be able to automatically assign the correct
# labels to all axes.
data_to_plot = pd.DataFrame(data=scores,
                            columns=pd.Index(bin_labels, name='Time (s)'),
                            index=pd.Index(ch_names, name='Channel'))

# First, plot the "raw" scores.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 8))
fig.suptitle(f'Automated noisy channel detection: {ch_type}',
             fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')
sns.heatmap(data=data_to_plot, cmap='Reds', cbar_kws=dict(label='Score'),
            ax=ax[0])
[ax[0].axvline(x, ls='dashed', lw=0.25, dashes=(25, 15), color='gray')
    for x in range(1, len(bins))]
ax[0].set_title('All Scores', fontweight='bold')

# Now, adjust the color range to highlight segments that exceeded the limit.
sns.heatmap(data=data_to_plot,
            vmin=np.nanmin(limits),  # bads in input data have NaN limits
            cmap='Reds', cbar_kws=dict(label='Score'), ax=ax[1])
[ax[1].axvline(x, ls='dashed', lw=0.25, dashes=(25, 15), color='gray')
    for x in range(1, len(bins))]
ax[1].set_title('Scores > Limit', fontweight='bold')

# The figure title should not overlap with the subplots.
fig.tight_layout(rect=[0, 0.03, 1, 0.95])

###############################################################################
#
# .. note:: You can use the very same code as above to produce figures for
#           *flat* channel detection. Simply replace the word "noisy" with
#           "flat", and replace ``vmin=np.nanmin(limits)`` with
#           ``vmax=np.nanmax(limits)``.
#
# You can see the un-altered scores for each channel and time segment in the
# left subplots, and thresholded scores – those which exceeded a certain limit
# of noisiness – in the right subplots. While the right subplot is entirely
# white for the magnetometers, we can see a horizontal line extending all the
# way from left to right for the gradiometers. This line corresponds to channel
# ``MEG 2443``, which was reported as auto-detected noisy channel in the step
# above. But we can also see another channel exceeding the limits, apparently
# in a more transient fashion. It was therefore *not* detected as bad, because
# the number of segments in which it exceeded the limits was less than 5,
# which MNE-Python uses by default.
#
# .. note:: You can request a different number of segments that must be
#           found to be problematic before
#           `~mne.preprocessing.find_bad_channels_maxwell` reports them as bad.
#           To do this, pass the keyword argument ``min_count`` to the
#           function.

###############################################################################
# Obviously, this algorithm is not perfect. Specifically, on closer inspection
# of the raw data after looking at the diagnostic plots above, it becomes clear
# that the channel exceeding the "noise" limits in some segments without
# qualifying as "bad", in fact contains some flux jumps. There were just not
# *enough* flux jumps in the recording for our automated procedure to report
# the channel as bad. So it can still be useful to manually inspect and mark
# bad channels. The channel in question is ``MEG 2313``. Let's mark it as bad:

raw.info['bads'] += ['MEG 2313']  # from manual inspection

###############################################################################
# After that, performing SSS and Maxwell filtering is done with a
# single call to :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter`, with the crosstalk
# and fine calibration filenames provided (if available):

raw_sss = mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter(
    raw, cross_talk=crosstalk_file, calibration=fine_cal_file, verbose=True)

###############################################################################
# To see the effect, we can plot the data before and after SSS / Maxwell
# filtering.

raw.pick(['meg']).plot(duration=2, butterfly=True)
raw_sss.pick(['meg']).plot(duration=2, butterfly=True)

###############################################################################
# Notice that channels marked as "bad" have been effectively repaired by SSS,
# eliminating the need to perform :ref:`interpolation <tut-bad-channels>`.
# The heartbeat artifact has also been substantially reduced.
#
# The :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter` function has parameters
# ``int_order`` and ``ext_order`` for setting the order of the spherical
# harmonic expansion of the interior and exterior components; the default
# values are appropriate for most use cases. Additional parameters include
# ``coord_frame`` and ``origin`` for controlling the coordinate frame ("head"
# or "meg") and the origin of the sphere; the defaults are appropriate for most
# studies that include digitization of the scalp surface / electrodes. See the
# documentation of :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter` for details.
#
#
# Spatiotemporal SSS (tSSS)
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# An assumption of SSS is that the measurement volume (the spherical shell
# where the sensors are physically located) is free of electromagnetic sources.
# The thickness of this source-free measurement shell should be 4-8 cm for SSS
# to perform optimally. In practice, there may be sources falling within that
# measurement volume; these can often be mitigated by using Spatiotemporal
# Signal Space Separation (tSSS) :footcite:`TauluSimola2006`.
# tSSS works by looking for temporal
# correlation between components of the internal and external subspaces, and
# projecting out any components that are common to the internal and external
# subspaces. The projection is done in an analogous way to
# :ref:`SSP <tut-artifact-ssp>`, except that the noise vector is computed
# across time points instead of across sensors.
#
# To use tSSS in MNE-Python, pass a time (in seconds) to the parameter
# ``st_duration`` of :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter`. This will
# determine the "chunk duration" over which to compute the temporal projection.
# The chunk duration effectively acts as a high-pass filter with a cutoff
# frequency of :math:`\frac{1}{\mathtt{st\_duration}}~\mathrm{Hz}`; this
# effective high-pass has an important consequence:
#
# - In general, larger values of ``st_duration`` are better (provided that your
#   computer has sufficient memory) because larger values of ``st_duration``
#   will have a smaller effect on the signal.
#
# If the chunk duration does not evenly divide your data length, the final
# (shorter) chunk will be added to the prior chunk before filtering, leading
# to slightly different effective filtering for the combined chunk (the
# effective cutoff frequency differing at most by a factor of 2). If you need
# to ensure identical processing of all analyzed chunks, either:
#
# - choose a chunk duration that evenly divides your data length (only
#   recommended if analyzing a single subject or run), or
#
# - include at least ``2 * st_duration`` of post-experiment recording time at
#   the end of the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object, so that the data you intend to
#   further analyze is guaranteed not to be in the final or penultimate chunks.
#
# Additional parameters affecting tSSS include ``st_correlation`` (to set the
# correlation value above which correlated internal and external components
# will be projected out) and ``st_only`` (to apply only the temporal projection
# without also performing SSS and Maxwell filtering). See the docstring of
# :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter` for details.
#
#
# Movement compensation
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# If you have information about subject head position relative to the sensors
# (i.e., continuous head position indicator coils, or :term:`cHPI`), SSS
# can take that into account when projecting sensor data onto the internal
# subspace. Head position data can be computed using
# :func:`mne.chpi.compute_chpi_locs` and :func:`mne.chpi.compute_head_pos`,
# or loaded with the:func:`mne.chpi.read_head_pos` function. The
# :ref:`example data <sample-dataset>` doesn't include cHPI, so here we'll
# load a :file:`.pos` file used for testing, just to demonstrate:

head_pos_file = os.path.join(mne.datasets.testing.data_path(), 'SSS',
                             'test_move_anon_raw.pos')
head_pos = mne.chpi.read_head_pos(head_pos_file)
mne.viz.plot_head_positions(head_pos, mode='traces')

###############################################################################
# The cHPI data file could also be passed as the ``head_pos`` parameter of
# :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter`. Not only would this account for
# movement within a given recording session, but also would effectively
# normalize head position across different measurement sessions and subjects.
# See :ref:`here <example-movement-comp>` for an extended example of applying
# movement compensation during Maxwell filtering / SSS. Another option is to
# apply movement compensation when averaging epochs into an
# :class:`~mne.Evoked` instance, using the :func:`mne.epochs.average_movements`
# function.
#
# Each of these approaches requires time-varying estimates of head position,
# which is obtained from MaxFilter using the ``-headpos`` and ``-hp``
# arguments (see the MaxFilter manual for details).
#
#
# Caveats to using SSS / Maxwell filtering
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# 1. There are patents related to the Maxwell filtering algorithm, which may
#    legally preclude using it in commercial applications. More details are
#    provided in the documentation of
#    :func:`~mne.preprocessing.maxwell_filter`.
#
# 2. SSS works best when both magnetometers and gradiometers are present, and
#    is most effective when gradiometers are planar (due to the need for very
#    accurate sensor geometry and fine calibration information). Thus its
#    performance is dependent on the MEG system used to collect the data.
