Locating Intracranial Electrode Contacts
========================================

Intracranial electrophysiology recording contacts are generally localized
based on a post-implantation computed tomography (CT) image and a
pre-implantation magnetic resonance (MR) image. The CT image has greater
intensity than the background at each of the electrode contacts and
for the skull. Using the skull, the CT can be aligned to MR-space.
Contact locations in MR-space are the goal because this is the image from which
brain structures can be determined using the
:ref:`tut-freesurfer-reconstruction`. Contact locations in MR-space can also
be translated to a template space such as ``fsaverage`` for group comparisons.

# deformation. This process takes approximately 8 hours so plan accordingly.

# Marking the Location of Each Electrode Contact
# ==============================================
#
# Now, the CT and the MR are in the same space, so when you are looking at a
# point in CT space, it is the same point in MR space. So now everything is
# ready to determine the location of each electrode contact in the
# individual subject's anatomical space (T1-space). To do this, can make
# list of ``TkReg RAS`` points from the lower panel in freeview or use the
# mne graphical user interface (coming soon). The electrode locations will then
# be in the ``surface RAS`` coordinate frame, which is helpful because that is
# the coordinate frame that all the surface and image files that freesurfer
# outputs are in, see :ref:`tut-freesurfer-mne`.
#
# The electrode contact locations could be determined using freeview by
# clicking through and noting each contact position in the interface launched
# by the following command:
#
# .. code-block:: bash
#
#     $ freeview $MISC_PATH/seeg/sample_seeg_T1.mgz \
#           $MISC_PATH/seeg/sample_seeg_CT.mgz

# Now, we'll need the subject's brain segmented out from the rest of the T1
# image from the freesurfer ``recon-all`` reconstruction. This is so that
# we don't have extraneous data outside the brain affecting our warp to a
# template brain.

# Warping to a Common Atlas
# =========================
#
# Electrode contact locations are often compared across subjects in a template
# space such as ``fsaverage`` or ``cvs_avg35_inMNI152``. To transform electrode
# contact locations to that space, we need to determine a function that maps
# from the subject's brain to the template brain. We will use the symmetric
# diffeomorphic registration (SDR) implemented by ``Dipy`` to do this.
#
# Before we can make a function to account for individual differences in the
# shape and size of brain areas, we need to fix the alignment of the brains.
# The plot below shows that they are not yet aligned.

# load the freesurfer average brain
template_brain = nib.load(
    op.join(subjects_dir, 'fsaverage', 'mri', 'brain.mgz'))

# %%
# Now, we'll register the affine of the subject's brain to the template brain.
# This aligns the two brains, preparing the subject's brain to be warped
# to the template.
#
# .. warning:: Here we use ``zooms=5`` just for speed, in general we recommend
#              using ``zooms=None``` (default) for highest accuracy. To deal
#              with this coarseness, we also use a threshold of 0.8 for the CT
#              electrodes rather than 0.95. This coarse zoom and low threshold
#              is useful for getting a quick view of the data, but finalized
#              pipelines should use ``zooms=None`` instead!

# Finally, we'll apply the registrations to the electrode contact coordinates.
# The brain image is warped to the template but the goal was to warp the
# positions of the electrode contacts. To do that, we'll make an image that is
# a lookup table of the electrode contacts. In this image, the background will
# be ``0`` s all the bright voxels near the location of the first contact will
# be ``1`` s, the second ``2`` s and so on. This image can then be warped by
