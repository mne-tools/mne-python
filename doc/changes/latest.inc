.. NOTE: we use cross-references to highlight new functions and classes.
   Please follow the examples below like :func:`mne.stats.f_mway_rm`, so the
   whats_new page will have a link to the function/class documentation.

.. NOTE: there are 3 separate sections for changes, based on type:
   - "Enhancements" for new features
   - "Bugs" for bug fixes
   - "API changes" for backward-incompatible changes

.. NOTE: changes from first-time contributors should be added to the TOP of
   the relevant section (Enhancements / Bugs / API changes), and should look
   like this (where xxxx is the pull request number):

       - description of enhancement/bugfix/API change (:gh:`xxxx` by
         :newcontrib:`Firstname Lastname`)

   Also add a corresponding entry for yourself in doc/changes/names.inc

Bugs
~~~~
- Fix :func:`mne.time_frequency.psd_array_multitaper` docstring where argument ``bandwidth`` incorrectly reported argument as half-bandwidth and gave wrong explanation of default value (:gh:`11479` by :newcontrib: `Tom Stone`_)
- Fix bug where installation of a package depending on ``mne`` will error when done in an environment where ``setuptools`` is not present (:gh:`11454` by :newcontrib: `Arne Pelzer`_)
- Fix bug where :func:`mne.preprocessing.regress_artifact` and :class:`mne.preprocessing.EOGRegression` incorrectly tracked ``picks`` (:gh:`11366` by `Eric Larson`_)
- Fix bug where channel names were not properly sanitized in :func:`mne.write_evokeds` and related functions (:gh:`11399` by `Eric Larson`_)
- Fix bug where splash screen would not always disappear (:gh:`11398` by `Eric Larson`_)
- Fix bug where having a different combination of volumes loaded into ``freeview`` caused different affines to be returned by :func:`mne.read_lta` for the same Linear Transform Array (LTA) (:gh:`11402` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
- Fix how :class:`mne.channels.DigMontage` is set when using ``mne.gui.locate_ieeg`` so that :func:`mne.Info.get_montage` works and does not return ``None`` (:gh:`11421` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
- Fix :func:`mne.io.read_raw_edf` when reading EDF data with different sampling rates and a mix of data channels when using ``infer_types=True`` (:gh:`11427` by `Alex Gramfort`_)
- Fix how :class:`mne.channels.DigMontage` is set when using :func:`mne.preprocessing.ieeg.project_sensors_onto_brain` so that :func:`mne.Info.get_montage` works and does not return ``None`` (:gh:`11436` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
- Fix configuration folder discovery on Windows, which would fail in certain edge cases; and produce a helpful error message if discovery still fails (:gh:`11441` by `Richard Höchenberger`_)
- Make :class:`~mne.decoding.SlidingEstimator` and :class:`~mne.decoding.GeneralizingEstimator` respect the ``verbose`` argument. Now with ``verbose=False``, the progress bar is not shown during fitting, scoring, etc. (:gh:`11450` by `Mikołaj Magnuski`_)

- All functions accepting paths can now correctly handle :class:`~pathlib.Path` as input. Historically, we expected strings (instead of "proper" path objects), and only added :class:`~pathlib.Path` support in a few select places, leading to inconsistent behavior. (:gh:`11473` and :gh:`11499` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Fix visualization dialog compatibility with matplotlib 3.7 (:gh:`11409` by `Daniel McCloy`_ and `Eric Larson`_)

- Fix bug in :func:`mne.export.export_raw` when exporting to EDF with a physical range set smaller than the data range (:gh:`11569` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Fix bug in :func:`mne.concatenate_raws` where two raws could not be merged if the order of the bad channel lists did not match (:gh:`11502` by `Moritz Gerster`_)
- Fix bug where :meth:`mne.Evoked.plot_topomap` opened an extra figure (:gh:`11607` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
- Fix bug where :func:`mne.transforms.apply_volume_registration_points` modified info in place (:gh:`11612` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
- In :class:`~mne.Report`, custom figures now show up correctly when ``image_format='svg'`` is requested (:gh:`11623` by `Richard Höchenberger`_)

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Deprecate ``mne.gui.locate_ieeg`` in favor of :func:`mne-gui-addons:mne_gui_addons.locate_ieeg` (:gh:`11616` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
- Deprecate arguments ``kind`` and ``path`` from :func:`mne.channels.read_layout` in favor of a common argument ``fname`` (:gh:`11500` by `Mathieu Scheltienne`_)
- Change ``aligned_ct`` positional argument in ``mne.gui.locate_ieeg`` to ``base_image`` to reflect that this can now be used with unaligned images (:gh:`11567` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
- ``mne.warp_montage_volume`` was deprecated in favor of :func:`mne.preprocessing.ieeg.warp_montage` (acts directly on points instead of using an intermediate volume) and :func:`mne.preprocessing.ieeg.make_montage_volume` (which makes a volume of ieeg contact locations which can still be useful) (:gh:`11572` by `Alex Rockhill`_)
