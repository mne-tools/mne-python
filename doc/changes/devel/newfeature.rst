We added new installation variants for a full installation with the PySide6 Qt framework
(``"mne[full-pyside6]"``), with the PyQt6 framework (``"mne[full-pyqt6]"``, equivalent to
``"mne[full]"``), and without any Qt framework (``"mne[full-no-qt]"``), which may be useful
in certain situations by `Richard HÃ¶chenberger`_.
