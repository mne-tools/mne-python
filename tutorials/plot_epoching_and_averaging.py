# In MNE, `epochs` refers to a collection of `single trials` or short segments
# of time locked raw data. If you haven't already, you might want to check out
# :ref:`tut_epochs_objects`. In this tutorial we take a deeper look into
# construction of epochs and averaging the epoch data to evoked instances.
# First let's read in the raw sample data.
data_path = mne.datasets.sample.data_path()
fname = op.join(data_path, 'MEG', 'sample', 'sample_audvis_raw.fif')
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(fname)
raw.set_eeg_reference('average', projection=True)  # set EEG average reference

###############################################################################
# To create time locked epochs, we first need a set of events that contain the
# information about the times. In this tutorial we use the stimulus channel to
# define the events. Let's look at the raw data.
order = np.arange(raw.info['nchan'])
order[9] = 312  # We exchange the plotting order of two channels
order[312] = 9  # to show the trigger channel as the 10th channel.
raw.plot(n_channels=10, order=order, block=True)

###############################################################################
# Notice channel ``STI 014`` at the bottom. It is the trigger channel that
# was used for combining all the events to a single channel. We can see that it
# has several pulses of different amplitude throughout the recording. These
# pulses correspond to different stimuli presented to the subject during the
# acquisition. The pulses have values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 32. These are the
# events we are going to align the epochs to. To create an event list from raw
# data, we simply call a function dedicated just for that. Since the event list
# is simply a numpy array, you can also manually create one. If you create one
# from an outside source (like a separate file of events), pay special
# attention in aligning the events correctly with the raw data.
events = mne.find_events(raw)
print('Found %s events, first five:' % len(events))
print(events[:5])

# Plot the events to get an idea of the paradigm
# Specify colors and an event_id dictionary for the legend.
event_id = {'Auditory/Left': 1, 'Auditory/Right': 2,
            'Visual/Left': 3, 'Visual/Right': 4,
            'smiley': 5, 'button': 32}
color = {1: 'green', 2: 'yellow', 3: 'red', 4: 'c', 5: 'black', 32: 'blue'}

mne.viz.plot_events(events, raw.info['sfreq'], raw.first_samp, color=color,
                    event_id=event_id)

###############################################################################
# The event list contains three columns. The first column corresponds to
# sample number. To convert this to seconds, you should divide the sample
# number by the used sampling frequency. The second column is reserved for the
# old value of the trigger channel at the time of transition, but is currently
# not in use. The third column is the trigger id (amplitude of the pulse).
#
# You might wonder why the samples don't seem to align with the plotted data.
# For instance, the first event has a sample number of 27977 which should
# translate to roughly 46.6 seconds (27977 / 600). However looking at
# the pulses we see the first pulse at 3.6 seconds. This is because Neuromag
# recordings have an attribute ``first_samp`` which refers to the offset
# between the system start and the start of the recording. Our data has a
# ``first_samp`` equal to 25800. This means that the first sample you see with
# ``raw.plot`` is the sample number 25800. Generally you don't need to worry
# about this offset as it is taken into account with MNE functions, but it is
# good to be aware of. Just to confirm, let's plot the events together with the
# raw data. Notice how the vertical lines (events) align nicely with the pulses
# on `STI 014`.
raw.plot(events=events, n_channels=10, order=order)

###############################################################################
# In this tutorial we are only interested in triggers 1, 2, 3 and 4. These
# triggers correspond to auditory and visual stimuli. The ``event_id`` here
# can be an int, a list of ints or a dict. With dicts it is possible to assign
# these ids to distinct categories. When using ints or lists this information
# is lost. First we shall define some parameters to feed to the
# :class:`mne.Epochs` constructor. The values ``tmin`` and ``tmax`` refer to
# offsets in relation to the events. Here we make epochs that collect the data
# from 200 ms before to 500 ms after the event.
tmin, tmax = -0.2, 0.5
event_id = {'Auditory/Left': 1, 'Auditory/Right': 2,
            'Visual/Left': 3, 'Visual/Right': 4}
# Only pick MEG and EOG channels.
picks = mne.pick_types(raw.info, meg=True, eeg=False, eog=True)

###############################################################################
# Now we have everything we need to construct the epochs. To get some
# meaningful results, we also want to baseline the epochs. Baselining computes
# the mean over the baseline period and adjusts the data accordingly. The
# epochs constructor uses a baseline period from ``tmin`` to 0.0 seconds by
# default, but it is wise to be explicit. That way you are less likely to end
# up with surprises along the way. ``None`` as the first element of the tuple
# refers to the start of the time window (-200 ms in this case).
# See :class:`mne.Epochs` for more.
#
# We also define rejection thresholds to get rid of noisy epochs. The
# rejection thresholds are defined as peak-to-peak values within the epoch time
# window. They are defined as T/m for gradiometers, T for magnetometers and V
# for EEG and EOG electrodes.
#
# .. note:: In this tutorial, we don't preprocess the data. This is not
#           something you would normally do. See our :ref:`documentation` on
#           preprocessing for more.
baseline = (None, 0.0)
reject = {'mag': 4e-12, 'eog': 200e-6}
epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events=events, event_id=event_id, tmin=tmin,
                    tmax=tmax, baseline=baseline, reject=reject, picks=picks)

###############################################################################
# Let's plot the epochs to see the results. The number at the top refers to the
# id number. We can see that 128 good epochs out of total of 145 events got
# through the rejection process. Visual inspection also reveals that some
# epochs containing saccades or blinks got through. You can also reject epochs
# by hand by clicking on the epoch in the browser window. The selected epochs
# get rejected when you close the epochs browser. How you should reject the
# epochs and which thresholds to use is not a trivial question and this
# tutorial takes no stand on that matter.
#
# To see all the interactive features of the epochs browser, click 'Help' in
# the lower left corner of the browser window.
epochs.plot(block=True)

###############################################################################
# To see why the epochs were rejected, we can plot the drop log.
epochs.plot_drop_log()

###############################################################################
# To get the evoked response you can simply do ``epochs.average()``. It
# includes only the data channels by default. For the sake of example, we use
# picks to include the EOG channels as well. Notice that we cannot use the
# same picks as before as the indices are different. 'Why are they different?'
# you might ask. They're different because ``picks`` is simply a list of
# channel indices and as the epochs were constructed, also a new info structure
# is created where the channel indices run from 0 to ``epochs.info['nchan']``.
# See :ref:`tut_info_objects` for more information.
picks = mne.pick_types(epochs.info, meg=True, eog=True)
evoked_left = epochs['Auditory/Left'].average(picks=picks)
evoked_right = epochs['Auditory/Right'].average(picks=picks)

###############################################################################
# Notice we have used forward slashes ('/') to separate the factors of the
# conditions of the experiment. We can use these 'tags' to select for example
# all left trials (both visual left and auditory right) ...

epochs_left = epochs['Left']

# ... or to select a very specific subset. This is the same as above:
evoked_left = epochs['Left/Auditory'].average(picks=picks)

# .. note::
#
#   It is also possible to add metadata to Epochs objects, allowing for
#   more complex selections on subsets of Epochs. See
#   :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_plot_metadata_epochs.py` for more
#   information.

# Finally, let's plot the evoked responses.
