MNE-Python Development
======================

.. NOTE: this first section (up until "overview of contribution process") is
   basically a copy/paste of CONTRIBUTING.rst from the repository root, with
   one sentence deleted to avoid self-referential linking. Changes made here
   should be mirrored there, and vice-versa.

MNE-Python is maintained by a community of scientists and research labs, and
accepts contributions in the form of bug reports, fixes, feature additions, and
documentation improvements (even just typo corrections). The best way to start
contributing is by `opening an issue`_ on our GitHub page to discuss your ideas
for changes or enhancements, or to tell us about behavior that you think might
be a bug in MNE-Python. *For general troubleshooting of scripts that use
MNE-Python*, you should instead post on the `MNE Forum`_. Users and
contributors to MNE-Python are expected to follow our `code of conduct`_.
