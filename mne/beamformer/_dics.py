    """Compute a Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) spatial filter.

    This is a beamformer filter that can be used to estimate the source power
    at a specific frequency range :footcite:`GrossEtAl2001`. It does this by
    constructing a spatial
    filter for each source point.  The computation of these filters is very
    similar to those of the LCMV beamformer (:func:`make_lcmv`), but instead of
    operating on a covariance matrix, the CSD matrix is used. When applying
    these filters to a CSD matrix (see :func:`apply_dics_csd`), the source
    power can be estimated for each source point.

    Parameters
    ----------
    info : instance of Info
        Measurement info, e.g. ``epochs.info``.
    forward : instance of Forward
        Forward operator.
    csd : instance of CrossSpectralDensity
        The data cross-spectral density (CSD) matrices. A source estimate is
        performed for each frequency or frequency-bin defined in the CSD
        object.
    reg : float
        The regularization to apply to the cross-spectral density before
        computing the inverse.
    noise_csd : instance of CrossSpectralDensity | None
        Noise cross-spectral density (CSD) matrices. If provided, whitening
        will be done. The noise CSDs need to have been computed for the same
        frequencies as the data CSDs. Providing noise CSDs is mandatory if you
        mix sensor types, e.g. gradiometers with magnetometers or EEG with
        MEG.

        .. versionadded:: 0.20
    label : Label | None
        Restricts the solution to a given label.
    %(bf_pick_ori)s
    %(rank_None)s

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
    %(weight_norm)s

        Defaults to ``None``, in which case no normalization is performed.
    %(reduce_rank)s
    %(depth)s
    real_filter : bool
        If ``True``, take only the real part of the cross-spectral-density
        matrices to compute real filters. Defaults to ``False``.
    %(bf_inversion)s

        .. versionchanged:: 0.21
           Default changed to ``'matrix'``.
    %(verbose)s

            'whitener' : None | ndarray, shape (n_channels, n_channels)
                Whitening matrix, provided if whitening was applied to the
                covariance matrix and leadfield during computation of the

    Notes
    -----
    The original reference is :footcite:`GrossEtAl2001`. See
    :footcite:`vanVlietEtAl2018` for a tutorial style paper on the topic.

    The DICS beamformer is very similar to the LCMV (:func:`make_lcmv`)
    beamformer and many of the parameters are shared. However,
    :func:`make_dics` and :func:`make_lcmv` currently have different defaults
    for these parameters, which were settled on separately through extensive
    practical use case testing (but not necessarily exhaustive parameter space
    searching), and it remains to be seen how functionally interchangeable they
    could be.

    The default setting reproduce the DICS beamformer as described in
    :footcite:`vanVlietEtAl2018`::

        inversion='single', weight_norm=None, depth=1.

    To use the :func:`make_lcmv` defaults, use::

        inversion='matrix', weight_norm='unit-noise-gain-invariant', depth=None

    For more information about ``real_filter``, see the
    supplemental information from :footcite:`HippEtAl2011`.

    DICS beamformer spatial filter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epochs : Epochs
        Single trial epochs.
    forward : dict
        Forward operator.
    noise_csds : list of instances of CrossSpectralDensity | None
        Noise cross-spectral density for each frequency bin. If these are
        specified, the DICS filters will be applied to both the signal and
        noise CSDs. The source power estimates for each frequency bin will be
        scaled by the estimated noise power (signal / noise).
        Specifying ``None`` will disable performing noise normalization.
    tmin : float
        Minimum time instant to consider.
    tmax : float
        Maximum time instant to consider.
    tstep : float
        Spacing between consecutive time windows, should be smaller than or
        equal to the shortest time window length.
    win_lengths : list of float
        Time window lengths in seconds. One time window length should be
        provided for each frequency bin.
    subtract_evoked : bool
        If True, subtract the averaged evoked response prior to computing the
        tf source grid. Defaults to False.
    mode : 'fourier' | 'multitaper' | 'cwt_morlet'
        Spectrum estimation mode. Defaults to 'fourier'.
    freq_bins : list of tuple of float
        Start and end point of frequency bins of interest.
        Only used in 'multitaper' or 'fourier' mode. For 'cwt_morlet' mode, use
        the ``frequencies`` parameter instead.
    frequencies : list of float | list of list of float
        The frequencies to compute the source power for. If you want to compute
        the average power for multiple frequency bins, specify a list of
        lists: each list containing the frequencies for the corresponding bin.
        Only used in 'cwt_morlet' mode. In other modes, use the ``freq_bins``
        parameter instead.
    n_ffts : list | None
        Length of the FFT for each frequency bin. If ``None`` (the default),
        the exact number of samples between ``tmin`` and ``tmax`` will be used.
        Only used in 'multitaper' or 'fourier' mode.
    mt_bandwidths : list of float
        The bandwidths of the multitaper windowing function in Hz. Only used in
        'multitaper' mode. One value should be provided for each frequency bin.
        Defaults to None.
    mt_adaptive : bool
        Use adaptive weights to combine the tapered spectra into CSD. Only used
        in 'multitaper' mode. Defaults to False.
    mt_low_bias : bool
        Only use tapers with more than 90%% spectral concentration within
        bandwidth. Only used in 'multitaper' mode. Defaults to True.
    cwt_n_cycles : float | list of float | None
        Number of cycles to use when constructing Morlet wavelets. Fixed number
        or one per frequency. Defaults to 7.
        Only used in 'cwt_morlet' mode.
    decim : int | slice
        To reduce memory usage, decimation factor during time-frequency
        decomposition. Defaults to 1 (no decimation).
        Only used in 'cwt_morlet' mode.

        If `int`, uses tfr[..., ::decim].
        If `slice`, uses tfr[..., decim].
    reg : float
        Regularization to use for the DICS beamformer computation.
        Defaults to 0.05.
    label : Label | None
        Restricts the solution to a given label. Defaults to None.
    pick_ori : None | 'normal' | 'max-power'
        The source orientation to estimate source power for:

            ``None`` :
                orientations are pooled. (Default)
            'normal' :
                filters are computed for the orientation tangential to the
                cortical surface
            'max-power' :
                filters are computer for the orientation that maximizes
                spectral power.

        Defaults to ``None``.

    rank : None | int | 'full'
        This controls the effective rank of the covariance matrix when
        computing the inverse. The rank can be set explicitly by specifying an
        integer value. If ``None``, the rank will be automatically estimated.
        Since applying regularization will always make the covariance matrix
        full rank, the rank is estimated before regularization in this case. If
        'full', the rank will be estimated after regularization and hence
        will mean using the full rank, unless ``reg=0`` is used.
        The default is None.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17
    inversion : 'single' | 'matrix'
        This determines how the beamformer deals with source spaces in "free"
        orientation. Such source spaces define three orthogonal dipoles at each
        source point. When ``inversion='single'``, each dipole is considered
        as an individual source and the corresponding spatial filter is
        computed for each dipole separately. When ``inversion='matrix'``, all
        three dipoles at a source vertex are considered as a group and the
        spatial filters are computed jointly using a matrix inversion. While
        ``inversion='single'`` is more stable, ``inversion='matrix'`` is more
        precise. See Notes of :func:`make_dics`.  Defaults to 'single'.
    weight_norm : None | 'unit-noise-gain'
        How to normalize the beamformer weights. None means no normalization is
        performed.  If 'unit-noise-gain', the unit-noise gain minimum variance
        beamformer will be computed (Borgiotti-Kaplan beamformer)
        :footcite:`SekiharaNagarajan2008`. Defaults to ``None``.
    %(depth)s
    real_filter : bool
        If ``True``, take only the real part of the cross-spectral-density
        matrices to compute real filters. Defaults to ``False``.
    %(reduce_rank)s
    %(verbose)s

    Returns
    -------
    stcs : list of SourceEstimate | VolSourceEstimate
        Source power at each time window. One SourceEstimate object is returned
        for each frequency bin.

    Notes
    -----
    Dalal et al. :footcite:`DalalEtAl2008` used a synthetic aperture
    magnetometry beamformer (SAM) in each time-frequency window instead of
    DICS.

    An alternative to using noise CSDs is to normalize the forward solution
    (``depth``) or the beamformer weights (``weight_norm``). In
    this case, ``noise_csds`` may be set to ``None``.
