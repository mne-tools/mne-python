==================================================
Background on Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
==================================================

Many M/EEG signals including biological artifacts reflect non-Gaussian
processes. Therefore PCA-based artifact rejection will likely perform worse at
separating the signal from noise sources.
MNE-Python supports identifying artifacts and latent components using temporal ICA.
MNE-Python implements the :class:`mne.preprocessing.ICA` class that facilitates applying ICA
to MEG and EEG data. Here we discuss some
basics of ICA.

Concepts
========

ICA finds directions in the feature space corresponding to projections with high non-Gaussianity.

- not necessarily orthogonal in the original feature space, but orthogonal in the whitened feature space.
- In contrast, PCA finds orthogonal directions in the raw feature
  space that correspond to directions accounting for maximum variance.
- or differently, if data only reflect Gaussian processes ICA and PCA are equivalent.


**Example**: Imagine 3 instruments playing simultaneously and 3 microphones
recording mixed signals. ICA can be used to recover the sources ie. what is played by each instrument.

ICA employs a very simple model: :math:`X = AS` where :math:`X` is our observations, :math:`A` is the mixing matrix and :math:`S` is the vector of independent (latent) sources.

The challenge is to recover :math:`A` and :math:`S` from :math:`X`.
