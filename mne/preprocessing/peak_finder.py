def peak_finder(x0, thresh=None, extrema=1, verbose=None):
    """Noise tolerant fast peak finding algorithm

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0 : 1d array
        A real vector from the maxima will be found (required).
    thresh : float
        The amount above surrounding data for a peak to be
        identified (default = (max(x0)-min(x0))/4). Larger values mean
        the algorithm is more selective in finding peaks.
    extrema : {-1, 1}
        1 if maxima are desired, -1 if minima are desired
        (default = maxima, 1).
    verbose : bool, str, int, or None
        If not None, override default verbose level (see mne.verbose).

    Returns
    -------
    peak_loc : array
        The indices of the identified peaks in x0
    peak_mag : array
        The magnitude of the identified peaks

    Note
    ----
    If repeated values are found the first is identified as the peak.
    Conversion from initial Matlab code from:
    Nathanael C. Yoder (ncyoder@purdue.edu)

    Example
    -------
    t = 0:.0001:10;
    x = 12*sin(10*2*pi*t)-3*sin(.1*2*pi*t)+randn(1,numel(t));
    x(1250:1255) = max(x);
