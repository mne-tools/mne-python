MNE-Python Development
======================

.. NOTE: this first section (up until "overview of contribution process") is
   basically a copy/paste of CONTRIBUTING.md from the repository root, with one
   sentence deleted to avoid self-referential linking. Changes made here should
   be mirrored there, and vice-versa.

MNE-Python is maintained by a community of scientists and research labs. The
project accepts contributions in the form of bug reports, fixes, feature
additions, and documentation improvements (including typo corrections). The
best way to start contributing is by `opening an issue`_ on our GitHub page to
discuss ideas for changes or enhancements, or to tell us about behavior that
you think might be a bug. For *general troubleshooting* or *usage questions*,
please consider posting your questions on our `MNE Forum`_.

Users and contributors to MNE-Python are expected to follow our
`code of conduct`_.

The `contributing guide`_ has details on the preferred contribution workflow
and the recommended system configuration for a smooth contribution/development
experience.
