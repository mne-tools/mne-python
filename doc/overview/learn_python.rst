Getting started with Python
===========================

`Python`_ is a modern general-purpose object-oriented high-level programming
language. There are many general introductions to Python online; here are a
few:

- The official `Python tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`__
- W3Schools `Python tutorial <https://www.w3schools.com/python/>`__
- Software Carpentry's `Python lesson <http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/>`_

Additionally, here are a couple tutorials focused on scientific programming in
Python:

- the `SciPy Lecture Notes <http://scipy-lectures.org/>`_
- `NumPy for MATLAB users <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html>`_

There are also many video tutorials online, including `videos from the annual
SciPy conferences
<https://www.youtube.com/user/EnthoughtMedia/playlists?shelf_id=1&sort=dd&view=50>`_.
One of those is a `Python introduction for complete beginners
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xmxy2NU9LOI>`_, but there are many more
lectures on advanced topics available as well.
